# Dashboards

**Sekoia.io’s Intelligence Center homepage uses a dashboard mechanism that is fully configurable and adaptable to your needs.**

Dashboards are composed of modular widgets that can be placed and edited wherever you want on the screen. Widgets can be fully configured as you can specify the date range, apply filters, change the display, etc.

## Default Dashboard

Accounts on Sekoia.io come with a preconfigured dashboard that gives a synthetic view of the current community activity, either from an operational security perspective (risk level, number of alerts, etc.) or from an activity perspective (list of last posted comments, last created alerts, etc.).

### Time range and refresh period

You can easily manage the time range and the refresh period of your dashboard by clicking on the selects in the top right of the screen.

## Create new Dashboard

### Create from scratch

The default Sekoia.io dashboard cannot be edited. However, you can create your own dashboards to meet your needs.
