# Build playbooks

A playbook starts with a trigger, can include conditions and consists of a succession of actions.

There are two ways to create a playbook:

- Use a pre-made template
- Build a playbook from scratch

## Templates

Creating a playbook from scratch can be complex. That’s why we provide our users with a way to quickly generate a playbook: **templates**.

These fully customizable templates are available in our Playbooks’ Catalog. You can access them by clicking on `+ Playbook` then selecting `Use a template`. These could be a really good working base.

The Playbook Templates' Catalog is being updated frequently by our analysts and here’s a list of the main ones. All playbook templates are available in the public repo on [Github](https://github.com/SEKOIA-IO/Community/tree/main/playbooks/templates) and our users are encouraged to add new templates to the repo.

## Build your playbooks from scratch

To create a playbook from scratch, you will need to create an empty playbook, go to the graphical view and start adding and configuring the following bricks in this specific order:

1. [Triggers](triggers.md): Alerts related triggers, manual triggers or Cron
2. [Operators](operators.md): Condition, Foreach, Store
3. [Actions](actions.md): Getters, Setters, External Data Enrichers, Notifications

Please refer to the documentation for each of these types to learn how to use them efficiently.

You can refer to our [playbook templates](https://github.com/SEKOIA-IO/Community/tree/main/playbooks/templates) and [use cases](/xdr/usecases/playbook/synchronize_alerts.md) for inspiration.

## Meta-playbook creation

When creating a playbook from a Workspace, user  can decide to which communities the playbook will apply to. User can select multiple communities in list or all communities by clicking “Select all”, it will create a meta-playbook when finalizing all steps of creation form.

If the user chooses to include only one child-type community (i.e. a non-parent community), there will be a final step where the user can decide whether the playbook remains a 'single tenant' playbook or becomes a Meta-playbook, allowing additional Communities to be added later.
