 # 🌟Event Standardization for Network Events

To ensure consistent recognition and semantic interpretation of network events, we follow the standardization guidelines bellow. We recommend users to adopt the same guidelines for their "network custom format". The supported network services include Vade, Varonis, Trellix, Proofpoint, Netskope, Gatewatcher, FortiGate, Darktrace, and Cisco.

## 📋 Required Fields

## 🛠️ Additional Fields

To provide more context and enhance the description of the events, the inclusion of additional fields is encouraged. The following additional fields can be used:

## Examples of event parsing
In this section, we will see how the raw messages are transformed into the ECS format for several examples of network security tools. 

### Fortinate Fortigate 
The following example is a DNS respone event generated by Fortigate Firewall. This event log indicates that a DNS response was processed by the FortiGate firewall. The DNS query was for the domain detectportal.firefox.com, which is typically used by Firefox for detecting captive portals. The query originated from the user "bob" with a source IP address of 10.1.100.11, and it was targeting 172.16.200.55 on port 53 (DNS). 

**Raw Event Before Parsing**
```CEF
CEF:0|Fortinet|Fortigate|v6.0.3|54802|dns:dns-response pass|3|deviceExternalId=FGT5HD3915800610 FTNTFGTlogid=1501054802 cat=dns:dns-response FTNTFGTsubtype=dns-response FTNTFGTlevel=notice FTNTFGTvd=vdom1 FTNTFGTeventtime=1545950726 FTNTFGTpolicyid=1 externalId=13355 duser=bob src=10.1.100.11 spt=54621 deviceInboundInterface=port12 FTNTFGTsrcintfrole=lan dst=172.16.200.55 dpt=53 deviceOutboundInterface=port11 FTNTFGTdstintfrole=wan proto=17 FTNTFGTprofile=default FTNTFGTsrcmac=a2:e9:00:ec:40:01 FTNTFGTxid=5137 FTNTFGTqname=detectportal.firefox.com FTNTFGTqtype=A FTNTFGTqtypeval=1 FTNTFGTqclass=IN FTNTFGTipaddr=104.80.89.26, 104.80.89.24 msg=Domain is monitored act=pass FTNTFGTcat=52 FTNTFGTcatdesc=Information Technology
```
* For instance, the `event.category` is derived from the key of the `name` field in the CEF raw event, which is set to 'dns:dns-response pass'. 
* Similarly, the `event.action` is directly extracted from the act field, which is 'pass'.

```

### Trellix Network Security 
The following example is a Trellix log detailing a high-severity IPS event (level 7). It identifies traffic from source IP 1.2.3.4 on port 80 to destination IP 5.6.7.8 on port 1109 as an Exploit Kit Landing Page. The system alerted stakeholders of this potential threat. The detection, associated with signature ID 85305161, was recorded on device cms-nx5600-1.eng.fireeye.com, with further details available via a provided URL. The source and destination MAC addresses were 6c:af:1a:fb:fe:a7 and 00:78:db:db:96:f6, respectively, and the event was categorized as a client attack.

**Raw Event Before Parsing**
```CEF
CEF:0|Trellix|MPS|10.0.0.992057|IE|ips-event|7|externalId=3463232 rt=Sep 05 2023 16:46:51 UTC proto=tcp src=1.2.3.4 spt=80 smac=6c:af:1a:fb:fe:a7 dst=5.6.7.8 dpt=1109 dmac=00:78:db:db:96:f6 cnt=1 cs1Label=sname cs1=Exploit Kit Landing Page act=notified dvchost=cms-nx5600-1.eng.fireeye.com dvc=3.4.5.6 dvcmac=e3:e9:d0:5e:ba:8e cn2=85305161 cn2Label=sid cfp1=12 cfp1Label=signature revision cs4=https://cms-nx5600-1.eng.fireeye.com/detection/objects?uuid\\=6682a2ba-bf3e-4c12-b7a1-822d648132fd cs4Label=link flexString2=client flexString2Label=attack mode msg=MVX Correlation Status:N/A cn1=0 cn1Label=vlan
```
* `event.action` is mapped directly from the CEF `act` field which is set to 'notified'.
* `event.category`is less intuitive in this example. However, if we check the expert descriptions of the parser, we can see that the default value `event.category` is set to 'intrusion_detection' and it takes another value only and only if `message.name`of our raw event matches 'domain-match', 'malware-object' or 'riskware-object'.

**ECS Fields After Parsing**

        "action": "notified",

Following these standards ensures that the EDR event data is consistent and can be easily interpreted and analyzed across different systems. This standardization helps in providing a unified view of security events and enhances the capability to respond to incidents efficiently.
