??? abstract "Cryptomining"
    
    Detection of domain names potentially related to cryptomining activities.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Discord Suspicious Download"
    
    Discord is a messaging application. It allows users to create their own communities to share messages and attachments. Those attachments have little to no overview and can be downloaded by almost anyone, which has been abused by attackers to host malicious payloads.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Download Files From Non-Legitimate TLDs"
    
    Detects file downloads from non-legitimate TLDs. Additional legitimates TLDs should be filtered according to the business habits.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Dynamic DNS Contacted"
    
    Detect communication with dynamic dns domain. This kind of domain is often used by attackers. This rule can trigger false positive in non-controlled environment because dynamic dns is not always malicious.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Exfiltration Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a possible exfiltration vector.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Koadic MSHTML Command"
    
    Detects Koadic payload using MSHTML module
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Remote Access Tool Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Feed"
    
    Detect threats based on indicators of compromise (IOCs) collected by SEKOIA's Threat and Detection Research team.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Sekoia.io EICAR Detection"
    
    Detects observables in Sekoia.io CTI tagged as EICAR, which are fake samples meant to test detection.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "TOR Usage Generic Rule"
    
    Detects TOR usage globally, whether the IP is a destination or source. TOR is short for The Onion Router, and it gets its name from how it works. TOR intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult. Before a network packet starts its journey, user’s computer chooses a random list of relays and repeatedly encrypts the data in multiple layers, like an onion. Each relay knows only enough to strip off the outermost layer of encryption, before passing what’s left on to the next relay in the list.
