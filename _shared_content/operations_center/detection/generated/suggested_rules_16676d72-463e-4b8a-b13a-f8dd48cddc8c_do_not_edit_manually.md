??? abstract "Bazar Loader DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm)"
    
    Detects Bazar Loader domains based on the Bazar Loader DGA
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Burp Suite Tool Detected"
    
    Burp Suite is a cybersecurity tool. When used as a proxy service, its purpose is to intercept packets and modify them to send them to the server. Burp Collaborator is a network service that Burp Suite uses to help discover many kinds of vulnerabilities (vulnerabilities scanner).

??? abstract "Cryptomining"
    
    Detection of domain names potentially related to cryptomining activities.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Dynamic DNS Contacted"
    
    Detect communication with dynamic dns domain. This kind of domain is often used by attackers. This rule can trigger false positive in non-controlled environment because dynamic dns is not always malicious.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Exfiltration Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a possible exfiltration vector.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Nimbo-C2 User Agent"
    
    Nimbo-C2 Uses an unusual User-Agent format in its implants.

??? abstract "Potential Azure AD Phishing Page (Adversary-in-the-Middle)"
    
    Detects an HTTP request to an URL typical of the Azure AD authentication flow, but towards a domain that is not one the legitimate Microsoft domains used for Azure AD authentication.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Potential Bazar Loader User-Agents"
    
    Detects potential Bazar loader communications through the user-agent
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Potential DNS Tunnel"
    
    Detects domain name which is longer than 95 characters. Long domain names are distinctive of DNS tunnels.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Potential Lemon Duck User-Agent"

    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "TOR Usage Generic Rule"
    
    Detects TOR usage globally, whether the IP is a destination or source. TOR is short for The Onion Router, and it gets its name from how it works. TOR intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult. Before a network packet starts its journey, user’s computer chooses a random list of relays and repeatedly encrypts the data in multiple layers, like an onion. Each relay knows only enough to strip off the outermost layer of encryption, before passing what’s left on to the next relay in the list.
