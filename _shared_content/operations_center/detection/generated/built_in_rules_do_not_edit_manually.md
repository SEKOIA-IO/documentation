Note: if you collect Entra ID SignInLogs, the rule "Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) Device Code Authentication" is a better equivalent to this rule.

??? abstract "Abusing Azure Browser SSO"
    
    Detects abusing Azure Browser SSO by requesting OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens for an Azure-AD-authenticated Windows user (i.e. the machine is joined to Azure AD and a user logs in with their Azure AD account) wanting to perform SSO authentication in the browser. An attacker can use this to authenticate to Azure AD in a browser as that user. This technique leverages the COM object (CoCreateInstance), which loads the DLL "C:\Windows\System32\MicrosoftAccountTokenProvider.dll", to get an authentication token. Monitoring the load of this DLL can detect an attacker abusing this technique. More details on this technique are available in the article in the source section. The prerequisite is to log for Loaded DLLs, it can be done using the Sysmon Event ID 7 (DLL image loaded by process).

??? abstract "Suspicious TOR Gateway"
    
    Detects suspicious TOR gateways. Gateways are often used by the victim to pay and decrypt the encrypted files without installing TOR. Tor intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult. Before a network packet starts its journey, user’s computer chooses a random list of relays and repeatedly encrypts the data in multiple layers, like an onion. Each relay knows only enough to strip off the outermost layer of encryption, before passing what’s left on to the next relay in the list.

??? abstract "SOCKS Tunneling Tool"
    
    Detects the usage of a SOCKS tunneling tool, often used by threat actors. These tools often use the socks5 commandline argument, however socks4 can sometimes be used as well. Unfortunately, socks alone (without any number) triggered too many false positives.

??? abstract "SSH Port Binding"
    
    When a user uses SSH tunneling in Linux, the sshd process binds sockets to communicate with the client machine via a ssh tunnel. With SSH tunneling, the SSH server can be used as a getaway to access internal systems. The traffic will seem to be coming from the SSH server whereas it only acts as a relay for an attacker. By using this technique, an attacker can successfully bypass external firewall rules. This rule is the most basic one (compared to the other one - SSH Tunnel), however it can detect the -D option in the ssh command if the machine is the client. This rule will detect the port binding (port 6010) when X11 forwarding is used. It will detect -R (server side), -D (client side) -X (server side), -Y (server side) and -L (client side) port binding.

??? abstract "SSH Tunnel Traffic"
    
    When a user creates and uses a SSH tunnel in Linux, the sshd process opens sockets to communicate with other machines or ports. With SSH tunneling, the SSH server can be used as a getaway to access internal systems. The traffic will seem to be coming from the SSH server whereas it only acts as a relay for an attacker. By using this technique, an attacker can successfully bypass external firewall rules and gain foothold to your network, allowing him to scan,hunt and attack your internal systems. This rule includes a filter on port 22, this filter is created to avoid false positive when a user is connecting via ssh. If you do not use port 22 for your machines, please create an alert filter.

??? abstract "SSH X11 Forwarding"
