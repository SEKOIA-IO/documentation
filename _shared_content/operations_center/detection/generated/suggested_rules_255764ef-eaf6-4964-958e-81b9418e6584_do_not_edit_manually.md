??? abstract "Adidnsdump Enumeration"
    
    Detects use of the tool adidnsdump for enumeration and discovering DNS records.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Advanced IP Scanner"
    
    Detects the use of Advanced IP Scanner. Seems to be a popular tool for ransomware groups.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Certify Or Certipy"
    
    Detects the use of certify and certipy which are two different tools used to enumerate and abuse Active Directory Certificate Services.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Cobalt Strike Default Beacons Names"
    
    Detects the default names of Cobalt Strike beacons / payloads.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Credential Dump Tools Related Files"
    
    Detects processes or file names related to credential dumping tools and the dropped files they generate by default.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Discord Suspicious Download"
    
    Discord is a messaging application. It allows users to create their own communities to share messages and attachments. Those attachments have little to no overview and can be downloaded by almost anyone, which has been abused by attackers to host malicious payloads.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Formbook File Creation DB1"
    
    Detects specific file creation (Users\*\AppData\Local\Temp\DB1) to store data to exfiltrate (Formbook behavior). Logging for Sysmon event 11 is usually used for this detection. 
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "HackTools Suspicious Names"
    
    Quick-win rule to detect the default process names or file names of several HackTools.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Koadic MSHTML Command"
    
    Detects Koadic payload using MSHTML module
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Linux Masquerading Space After Name"
    
    This detection rule identifies a process created from an executable with a space appended to the end of the name.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "NTDS.dit File In Suspicious Directory"
    
    The file NTDS.dit is supposed to be located mainly in C:\Windows\NTDS. The rule checks whether the file is in a legitimate directory or not (through file creation events). This is usually really suspicious and could indicate an attacker trying copy the file to then look for users password hashes.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "OneNote Embedded File"
    
    Detects creation or uses of OneNote embedded files with unusual extensions.  
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "PasswordDump SecurityXploded Tool"
    
    Detects the execution of the PasswordDump SecurityXploded Tool
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Phorpiex Process Masquerading"
    
    Detects specific process executable path used by the Phorpiex botnet to masquerade its system process network activity. It looks for a pattern of a system process executable name that is not legitimate and running from a folder that is created via a random algorithm 13-15 numbers long.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Potential Azure AD Phishing Page (Adversary-in-the-Middle)"
    
    Detects an HTTP request to an URL typical of the Azure AD authentication flow, but towards a domain that is not one the legitimate Microsoft domains used for Azure AD authentication.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Process Trace Alteration"
    
    PTrace syscall provides a means by which one process ("tracer") may observe and control the execution of another process ("tracee") and examine and change the tracee's memory and registers. Attacker might want to abuse ptrace functionnality to analyse memory process. It requires to be admin or set ptrace_scope to 0 to allow all user to trace any process.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "RTLO Character"
    
    Detects RTLO (Right-To-Left character) in file and process names.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Remote Monitoring and Management Software - AnyDesk"
    
    Detect artifacts related to the installation or execution of the Remote Monitoring and Management tool AnyDesk.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Remote Monitoring and Management Software - Atera"
    
    Detect artifacts related to the installation or execution of the Remote Monitoring and Management tool Atera.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Suspicious ADSI-Cache Usage By Unknown Tool"
    
    Detects the usage of ADSI (LDAP) operations by tools. This may also detect tools like LDAPFragger. It needs file monitoring capabilities (Sysmon Event ID 11 with .sch file creation logging).
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Suspicious PROCEXP152.sys File Created In Tmp"
    
    Detects the creation of the PROCEXP152.sys file in the application-data local temporary folder. This driver is used by Sysinternals Process Explorer but also by KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU) or Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs), which uses KDU. Note - Clever attackers may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the driver filename. Therefore just Medium-level and don't rely on it.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Suspicious desktop.ini Action"
    
    Detects unusual processes accessing desktop.ini, which can be leveraged to alter how Explorer displays a folder's content (i.e. renaming files) without changing them on disk.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "WCE wceaux.dll Creation"
    
    Detects wceaux.dll creation while Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) is executed.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Webshell Creation"
    
    Detects possible webshell file creation. It requires File Creation monitoring, which can be done using Sysmon's Event ID 11. However the recommended SwiftOnSecurity configuration does not fully cover the needs for this rule, it needs to be updated with the proper file names extensions.
    
    - **Effort:** master
