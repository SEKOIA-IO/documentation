??? abstract "Bazar Loader DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm)"
    
    Detects Bazar Loader domains based on the Bazar Loader DGA
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Cobalt Strike DNS Beaconing"
    
    Detects suspicious DNS queries known from Cobalt Strike beacons. The threshold is more than 50 suspicious DNS requests to avoid false positives.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Correlation Potential DNS Tunnel"
    
    Detects domain name which is longer than 95 characters. Long domain names are distinctive of DNS tunnels.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Cryptomining"
    
    Detection of domain names potentially related to cryptomining activities.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Dynamic DNS Contacted"
    
    Detect communication with dynamic dns domain. This kind of domain is often used by attackers. This rule can trigger false positive in non-controlled environment because dynamic dns is not always malicious.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "EfficientIP SOLIDServer Suspicious Behavior"
    
    Detects when EfficientIP SOLIDServer forwards a suspicious behavior related to an IP.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "EvilProxy Phishing Domain"
    
    Detects subdomains potentially generated by the EvilProxy adversary-in-the-middle phishing platform. Inspect the other subdomains of the domain to identify the landing page, and determine if the user submitted credentials. This rule has a small percentage of false positives on legitimate domains.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Exfiltration Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a possible exfiltration vector.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Internet Scanner"
    
    Detects known scanner IP addresses. Alert is only raised when the scan hits an opened port, on TCP or UDP. This could be a very noisy rule, so be careful to check your detection perimeter before activation.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Internet Scanner Target"
    
    Detects known scanner IP addresses. Alert is only raised when the scan hits an opened port, on TCP or UDP and group by target address. This could be a very noisy rule, so be careful to check your detection perimeter before activation.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Potential DNS Tunnel"
    
    Detects domain name which is longer than 95 characters. Long domain names are distinctive of DNS tunnels.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Remote Access Tool Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Remote Monitoring and Management Software - AnyDesk"
    
    Detect artifacts related to the installation or execution of the Remote Monitoring and Management tool AnyDesk.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Remote Monitoring and Management Software - Atera"
    
    Detect artifacts related to the installation or execution of the Remote Monitoring and Management tool Atera.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Feed"
    
    Detect threats based on indicators of compromise (IOCs) collected by SEKOIA's Threat and Detection Research team.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Sekoia.io EICAR Detection"
    
    Detects observables in Sekoia.io CTI tagged as EICAR, which are fake samples meant to test detection.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Sliver DNS Beaconing"
    
    Detects suspicious DNS queries known from Sliver beaconing 
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Suspicious TOR Gateway"
    
    Detects suspicious TOR gateways. Gateways are often used by the victim to pay and decrypt the encrypted files without installing TOR. Tor intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult. Before a network packet starts its journey, user’s computer chooses a random list of relays and repeatedly encrypts the data in multiple layers, like an onion. Each relay knows only enough to strip off the outermost layer of encryption, before passing what’s left on to the next relay in the list.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "TOR Usage Generic Rule"
    
    Detects TOR usage globally, whether the IP is a destination or source. TOR is short for The Onion Router, and it gets its name from how it works. TOR intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult.

??? abstract "Telegram Bot API Request"
    
    Detects suspicious DNS queries to api.telegram.org used by Telegram Bots of any kind
    
    - **Effort:** advanced
