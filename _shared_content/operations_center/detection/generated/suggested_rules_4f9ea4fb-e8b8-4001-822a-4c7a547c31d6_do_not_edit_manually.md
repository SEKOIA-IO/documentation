    - **Effort:** advanced

    Detection of domain names potentially related to cryptomining activities.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Dynamic DNS Contacted"
    
    Detect communication with dynamic dns domain. This kind of domain is often used by attackers. This rule can trigger false positive in non-controlled environment because dynamic dns is not always malicious.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Exfiltration Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a possible exfiltration vector.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "HTA Infection Chains"
    
    Detect the creation of a ZIP file and an HTA file as it is often used in infection chains. Furthermore it also detects the use of suspicious processes launched by explorer.exe combined with the creation of an HTA file, since it is also often used in infection chains (LNK - HTA for instance).
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "HTML Smuggling Suspicious Usage"
    
    Based on several samples from different botnets, this rule aims at detecting HTML infection chain by looking for HTML created files followed by suspicious files being executed.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "HackTools Suspicious Names"
    
    Quick-win rule to detect the default process names or file names of several HackTools.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "ISO LNK Infection Chain"
    
    Detection of an ISO (or any other similar archive file) downloaded file, followed by a child-process of explorer, which is characteristic of an infection using an ISO containing an LNK file. For events with `host.name`.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "NTDS.dit File In Suspicious Directory"
    
    The file NTDS.dit is supposed to be located mainly in C:\Windows\NTDS. The rule checks whether the file is in a legitimate directory or not (through file creation events). This is usually really suspicious and could indicate an attacker trying copy the file to then look for users password hashes.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "OneNote Embedded File"
    
    Detects creation or uses of OneNote embedded files with unusual extensions.  
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "PasswordDump SecurityXploded Tool"
    
    Detects the execution of the PasswordDump SecurityXploded Tool
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Process Trace Alteration"
    
    PTrace syscall provides a means by which one process ("tracer") may observe and control the execution of another process ("tracee") and examine and change the tracee's memory and registers. Attacker might want to abuse ptrace functionnality to analyse memory process. It requires to be admin or set ptrace_scope to 0 to allow all user to trace any process.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "RTLO Character"
    
    Detects RTLO (Right-To-Left character) in file and process names.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Remote Access Tool Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Remote Monitoring and Management Software - AnyDesk"
    
    Detect artifacts related to the installation or execution of the Remote Monitoring and Management tool AnyDesk.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Remote Monitoring and Management Software - Atera"
    
    Detect artifacts related to the installation or execution of the Remote Monitoring and Management tool Atera.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Feed"
    
    Detect threats based on indicators of compromise (IOCs) collected by SEKOIA's Threat and Detection Research team.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Sekoia.io EICAR Detection"
    
    Detects observables in Sekoia.io CTI tagged as EICAR, which are fake samples meant to test detection.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Suspicious File Name"
    
    Detects suspicious file name possibly linked to malicious tool.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Suspicious PROCEXP152.sys File Created In Tmp"
    
    Detects the creation of the PROCEXP152.sys file in the application-data local temporary folder. This driver is used by Sysinternals Process Explorer but also by KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU) or Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs), which uses KDU. Note - Clever attackers may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the driver filename. Therefore just Medium-level and don't rely on it.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "TOR Usage Generic Rule"
    
    Detects TOR usage globally, whether the IP is a destination or source. TOR is short for The Onion Router, and it gets its name from how it works. TOR intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult. Before a network packet starts its journey, user’s computer chooses a random list of relays and repeatedly encrypts the data in multiple layers, like an onion. Each relay knows only enough to strip off the outermost layer of encryption, before passing what’s left on to the next relay in the list.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "WCE wceaux.dll Creation"
    
    Detects wceaux.dll creation while Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) is executed.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Webshell Creation"
    
    Detects possible webshell file creation. It requires File Creation monitoring, which can be done using Sysmon's Event ID 11. However the recommended SwiftOnSecurity configuration does not fully cover the needs for this rule, it needs to be updated with the proper file names extensions.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "ZIP LNK Infection Chain"
    
    Detection of an ZIP download followed by a child-process of explorer, followed by multiple Windows processes.This is widely used as an infection chain mechanism.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced
