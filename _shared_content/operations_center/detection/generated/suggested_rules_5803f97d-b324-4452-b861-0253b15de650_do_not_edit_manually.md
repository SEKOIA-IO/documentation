??? abstract "Account Added To A Security Enabled Group"
    
    Detection in order to investigate who has added a specific Domain User in Domain Admins or Group Policy Creator Owners (Security event 4728)
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Account Removed From A Security Enabled Group"
    
    Detection in order to investigate who has removed a specific Domain User in Domain Admins or Group Policy Creator Owners (Security event 4729)
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Computer Account Deleted"
    
    Detects computer account deletion.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Cryptomining"
    
    Detection of domain names potentially related to cryptomining activities.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Domain Trust Created Or Removed"
    
    A trust was created or removed to a domain. An attacker could perform that in order to do lateral movement easily between domains or shutdown the ability of two domains to communicate.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Dynamic DNS Contacted"
    
    Detect communication with dynamic dns domain. This kind of domain is often used by attackers. This rule can trigger false positive in non-controlled environment because dynamic dns is not always malicious.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Exfiltration Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a possible exfiltration vector.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Lacework Cloud Security Critical Severity Alert"
    
    Detects when a critical alert severity is raised by Lacework. This severity level might indicates a suspicious change in configuration or policy violation.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Lacework Cloud Security High Severity Alert"
    
    Detects when a high alert severity is raised by Lacework. This severity level might indicates a suspicious change in configuration or policy violation.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Lacework Cloud Security Low Severity Alert"
    
    Detects when a low alert severity is raised by Lacework. This severity level might indicates a change in configuration that could be malicious or not.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Lacework Cloud Security Medium Severity Alert"
    
    Detects when a medium alert severity is raised by Lacework. This severity level might indicates a suspicious activity such as new source from user connection.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Password Change On Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account"
    
    The Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) account is a local administrator account on Domain Controllers. Attackers may change the password to gain persistence.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Possible Replay Attack"
    
    This event can be a sign of Kerberos replay attack or, among other things, network device configuration or routing problems.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Remote Access Tool Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT).
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Feed"
    
    Detect threats based on indicators of compromise (IOCs) collected by SEKOIA's Threat and Detection Research team.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Sekoia.io EICAR Detection"
    
    Detects observables in Sekoia.io CTI tagged as EICAR, which are fake samples meant to test detection.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "TOR Usage Generic Rule"
    
    Detects TOR usage globally, whether the IP is a destination or source. TOR is short for The Onion Router, and it gets its name from how it works. TOR intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult. Before a network packet starts its journey, user’s computer chooses a random list of relays and repeatedly encrypts the data in multiple layers, like an onion. Each relay knows only enough to strip off the outermost layer of encryption, before passing what’s left on to the next relay in the list.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "User Account Deleted"
    
    Detects local user deletion
    
    - **Effort:** master
