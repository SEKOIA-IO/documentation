??? abstract "Cron Files Alteration"
    
    Cron Files and Cron Directory alteration used by attacker for persistency or privilege escalation.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "Cryptomining"
    
    Detection of domain names potentially related to cryptomining activities.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "Dynamic DNS Contacted"
    
    Detect communication with dynamic dns domain. This kind of domain is often used by attackers. This rule can trigger false positive in non-controlled environment because dynamic dns is not always malicious.

??? abstract "Exfiltration Domain"
    
    Detects traffic toward a domain flagged as a possible exfiltration vector.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "NTDS.dit File In Suspicious Directory"
    
    The file NTDS.dit is supposed to be located mainly in C:\Windows\NTDS. The rule checks whether the file is in a legitimate directory or not (through file creation events). This is usually really suspicious and could indicate an attacker trying copy the file to then look for users password hashes.
    
    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "OneNote Embedded File"
    
    Detects creation or uses of OneNote embedded files with unusual extensions.  
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Package Manager Alteration"

    - **Effort:** advanced

??? abstract "RTLO Character"
    
    Detects RTLO (Right-To-Left character) in file and process names.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "Remote Access Tool Domain"

    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Feed"
    
    Detect threats based on indicators of compromise (IOCs) collected by SEKOIA's Threat and Detection Research team.
    
    - **Effort:** elementary

??? abstract "SSH Authorized Key Alteration"
    
    The file authorized_keys is used by SSH server to identify SSH keys that are authorized to connect to the host, alteration of one of those files might indicate a user compromision.

??? abstract "Sekoia.io EICAR Detection"
    
    Detects observables in Sekoia.io CTI tagged as EICAR, which are fake samples meant to test detection.
    
    - **Effort:** master

??? abstract "TOR Usage Generic Rule"
    
    Detects TOR usage globally, whether the IP is a destination or source. TOR is short for The Onion Router, and it gets its name from how it works. TOR intercepts the network traffic from one or more apps on user’s computer, usually the user web browser, and shuffles it through a number of randomly-chosen computers before passing it on to its destination. This disguises user location, and makes it harder for servers to pick him/her out on repeat visits, or to tie together separate visits to different sites, this making tracking and surveillance more difficult. Before a network packet starts its journey, user’s computer chooses a random list of relays and repeatedly encrypts the data in multiple layers, like an onion. Each relay knows only enough to strip off the outermost layer of encryption, before passing what’s left on to the next relay in the list.

??? abstract "WCE wceaux.dll Creation"
    
    Detects wceaux.dll creation while Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) is executed.
    
    - **Effort:** intermediate

??? abstract "Webshell Creation"
    
    Detects possible webshell file creation. It requires File Creation monitoring, which can be done using Sysmon's Event ID 11. However the recommended SwiftOnSecurity configuration does not fully cover the needs for this rule, it needs to be updated with the proper file names extensions.
