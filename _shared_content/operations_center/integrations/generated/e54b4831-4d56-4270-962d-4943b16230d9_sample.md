### Raw Events Samples

In this section, you will find examples of raw logs as generated natively by the source. These examples are provided to help integrators understand the data format before ingestion into Sekoia.io. It is crucial for setting up the correct parsing stages and ensuring that all relevant information is captured.

            "description": "This rule checks whether the IAM resource policy is overly permissive.  \nThis rule fails if the policy contains a `Statement` where:\n* `Effect` is set to `Allow`\n* `Principal` contains a wildcard (`*`, `AWS:*`)\n* `Resource` contains an ARN of `execute-api`, `s3`, or `sqs`, or a wildcard (`*`) which includes these resources\n* `Condition` of type `ForAllValues.aws:PrincipalArn` exists\n\nSetting the principal clause for all (`*`, `AWS:*`) in Amazon S3, SQS, and API Gateway resources could inadvertently allow anonymous access to resources, and the `ForAllValues` condition quantifier evaluates to `True` if no key is given, such as in the case of an unauthenticated user.  \nSuch policy statement elements could inadvertently allow anonymous access to resources in these services.  \nIt is strongly recommended to edit the resource policy to exclude this permissive statement.",
            "remediationInstructions": "Perform the following commands to delete or modify the IAM policy via AWS CLI:    \n1. First, use the following command to list the IAM entities (User\\Role\\Group) that have the policy attached (if any):  \n```  \naws iam list-entities-for-policy \\\n    --policy-arn <value>  \n```  \nIf the policy **is not attached** to IAM entities - proceed to 2a.    \nIf the policy **is attached** to one or more IAM entities - proceed to 2b.    \n2a. As this policy is not in use, It is recommended to delete it. Use the following command to delete the policy:  \n```  \naws iam delete-policy \\\n    --policy-arn <value>  \n```  \n2b. It is recommended to edit the policy to remove the permissive action. First, use the following command to view the actions of the policy:  \n```  \naws iam get-policy-version \\\n    --policy-arn <value> \\\n    --version-id <value>  \n```  \nIf you are not sure what the policy version id is, use the following command to check. The current version id is the `DefaultVersionId`.  \n```  \naws iam get-policy \\\n    --policy-arn <value>  \n```  \nOnce you have located the overly-permissive action(s), create a new JSON file that excludes the permissive actions. Use the following command to create a new policy version and set it to default:  \n```  \naws iam create-policy-version \\\n    --policy-arn <value> \\\n    --policy-document file://<NewPolicyVersion.json> \\\n    --set-as-default  \n```  \nTo fix this insecure policy, apply one of the following solutions:    \n* Avoid using `\"AWS\": \"*\"` or `\"*\"` principals for the affected resources.   \n Allowing wide access to a resource is insecure. Instead, use specific principals with their AWS account id.    \n* For a single-valued condition key like `PrincipalArn`, use the `StringEquals` / `StringLike` condition operators instead of the `ForAllValues` operator.",
