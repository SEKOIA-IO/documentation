### Event Categories


The following table lists the data source offered by this integration.

| Data Source | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Host network interface` | every packets are logged |
| `Netflow/Enclave netflow` | Umbrella IP logs are Netflow-like |
| `Network device logs` | packets logged by Umbrella IP |
| `Network protocol analysis` | traffic analysis at levels 2/3/4 |








### Transformed Events Samples after Ingestion

This section demonstrates how the raw logs will be transformed by our parsers. It shows the extracted fields that will be available for use in the [built-in detection rules](/xdr/features/detect/rules_catalog.md) and hunting activities in the [events page](/xdr/features/investigate/events.md). Understanding these transformations is essential for analysts to create effective detection mechanisms with [custom detection rules](/xdr/features/detect/sigma.md) and to leverage the full potential of the collected data.

### Extracted Fields

The following table lists the fields that are extracted, normalized under the ECS format, analyzed and indexed by the parser. It should be noted that infered fields are not listed.

| Name | Type | Description                |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------------------|
|`@timestamp` | `date` | Date/time when the event originated. |
|`action.target` | `keyword` | Target of the action |
|`destination.ip` | `ip` | IP address of the destination. |
|`destination.port` | `long` | Port of the destination. |
|`host.hostname` | `keyword` | Hostname of the host. |
|`source.ip` | `ip` | IP address of the source. |
|`source.port` | `long` | Port of the source. |
