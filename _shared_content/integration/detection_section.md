## Detection section

The following section provides information for those who wish to learn more about the detection capabilities enabled by collecting this intake. It includes details about the built-in rule catalog, event categories, and ECS fields extracted from raw events. This is essential for users aiming to create [custom detection rules](/xdr/features/detect/sigma.md), perform hunting activities, or pivot in the [events page](/xdr/features/investigate/events.md).
