#### Configure a forwarder

To forward netflow events to sekoia, use the [Sekoia.io Netflow forwarder](/integration/ingestion_methods/netflow/sekoiaio_netflow_concentrator.md) which is the official supported way to collect netflow events. In charge of centralizing data coming from many equipments/sources and forwarding them to Sekoia.io with the apporpriated format, it is a prepackaged option. You only have to provide your intake key as parameter.
