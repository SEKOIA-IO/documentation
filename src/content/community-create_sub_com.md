MSSP community with multiple managed communities: for MSSP partners with SOC/CERT activities
Sub-community creation is only available on MSSP mode only

# Create a new sub-community

For the managed community with multiple entities, our support team will handle the creation of the community and assist you to add the necessary [entities](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/entities/). 

However, for the MSSP community, the support team can create the main MSSP community and users with the right permissions can add multiple communities from the user interface. 

To create a managed community in an MSSP environment:

1. Go to `Managed communities` from your avatar in the upper right of the screen 
2. On the right, youâ€™ll find a list of all managed communities within the main MSSP community. Click on the button `+ Community`
3. Provide a name, a description and a link to a website (optional) 
4. Save

Your newly created community now appears in the listing of your managed communities.
