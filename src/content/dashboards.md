# Dashboards
**Sekoia.ioâ€™s Operations Center homepage uses a dashboard mechanism that is fully configurable and adaptable to your needs.**
Dashboards are composed of modular widgets that can be placed and edited wherever you want on the screen. Widgets can be fully configured as you can specify the date range, apply filters, change the display, etc...

## Default Dashboard
Accounts on Sekoia.io come with a preconfigured dashboard that gives a synthetic view of the current community activity, either from an operational security perspective (risk level, number of alerts, etc.) or from an activity perspective (list of last posted comments, last created alerts, etc.).
### Time range and refresh period
You can easily manage the time range and the refresh period of your dashboard by clicking on the selects in the top right of the screen.

## Create new Dashboard
### Create from scratch
The default Sekoia.io dashboard cannot be edited. However, you can create your own dashboards to meet your needs.
To do so, several widgets are available to you with the possibility to configure and add multiple filters to them.
To create a new dashboard, you have to:

1. Go to the `Settings` button in the upper right of the screen
2. Click on `Create a new dashboard`
3. Give your dashboard a name and a description
4. Save
5. Click on `Add widget` and select a widget from the list in the right panel
6. Drag the needed widget in the workspace and edit it following your needs
7. Click on `Save`
To access your dashboards, you have to click on the name of the dashboard in the upper left of the screen and choose a dashboard from the list.

!!! note
    Dashboards you create will be available to all members of your community.

The Default Dashboard cannot be deleted.

## Risk Level Widget

The Risk Level Widget shows the risk level of your infrastructure based on your alerts.

The risk level is computed by entity. The maximum risk level is then considered to be the community risk level.

All the opened (i.e. in status pending, acknowledged, or ongoing) alerts seen in the last 30 days are taken into consideration to calculate the risk level.
Then, for each alert, we apply some weighting based on the urgency, occurrence, and date of the alert.
The goal is to give more importance to the more recent, urgent, and recurrent alerts.

The Risk Level value is normalized to provide a number between 0 and 100.
