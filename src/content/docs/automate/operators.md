# Operators

## Types of Operators

Operators are used to filter, loop or store data generated by a `Trigger` or an `Action`.

The list of Operators can be displayed by clicking on `Operators` in the library:

### Condition

The `Condition` Operator is used to evaluate one or several expressions to check if they are true or false. It is similar to the If/Else If/Else conditions
that you can find in programming. A `Condition` therefore allows conditional execution of your playbook based on the evaluation of these expressions.

To add a condition, it is needed to add a case, by clicking on the `+` button then `Add form`:

When you create a case, you need to configure it by filling the fields:

- `Comparaison` - The comparison element of your expression
- `Left` - the left part of your expression before the comparison element
- `Right` - the right part of your expression after the comparison element
- `Name` - Name of your case

**Example**:

In this exemple, a condition is created to check if the rule name that triggered the playbook - `{{ node.1['rule']['name'] }}` - is the `SEKOIA Intelligence Feed` rule.

#### Comparison types
This array shows the different types of comparison available with examples:

|Comparison|Meaning|Exemple left|Exemple right|Additional information|
|----------|-------|------------|-------------|----------------------|
|==|Equal to|{{ node.1['rule']['name'] }}|SEKOIA Intelligence Feed||
|!=|Not equal to|{{ node.1['rule']['name'] }}|SEKOIA Intelligence Feed||
|<|Less than|{{ node.1['urgency']['current_value'] }}|{{ 80 }}|For number comparison, it is needed to transform the value as an "Integer" because it is interpreted as a String by default. For that the value is surrounded by curly brackets.|
|>|Greater than|{{ node.1['urgency']['current_value'] }}|{{ 80 }}|For number comparison, it is needed to transform the value as an "Integer" because it is interpreted as a String by default. For that the value is surrounded by curly brackets.|
|<=|Less than or equal to|{{ node.1['urgency']['current_value'] }}|{{ 80 }}|For number comparison, it is needed to transform the value as an "Integer" because it is interpreted as a String by default. For that the value is surrounded by curly brackets.|
|>=|Greater than or equal to|{{ node.1['urgency']['current_value'] }}|{{ 80 }}|For number comparison, it is needed to transform the value as an "Integer" because it is interpreted as a String by default. For that the value is surrounded by curly brackets.|
|in|Includes in|{{ node.1['rule']['name'] }}|["my rule 1", "my second rule", "my third rule"]||
|not in|Not includes in|{{ node.1['rule']['name'] }}|["my rule 1", "my second rule", "my third rule"]||
|range|In the range of|{{ node.1['urgency']['current_value'] }}|[{{10}}, {{100}}]|Edge values are included in the range|

### Foreach

The Operator `Foreach` is specialised in the browsing of a list of data.

To configure the `Foreach`, you need to fill the field `Items` corresponding of the list of data.

This Operator has two output branches:

* One called `loop` which will be executed for every item in the list.
* One that will be executed after the loop on the different items is finished.

The `Foreach` module has 3 outputs:

- `node.X.default.value` - The reference of the current item in the loop
- `node.X.default.index` - The number of iterations performed (starts at 0)
- `node.X.default.total` - The total number of items

For instance, if the `Foreach` is the node `3` and you want to get the reference of the current item in the loop, you can use `{{node.3.default.value}}`

### Store

The Operator `Store` allows a user to store data in a step of a playbook and retrieve it in another module.
A data is always associated to a `key`. To store an information, you have to create a `modification` by clicking on `+` then `Add form`.

![Sekoia.io Operations Center Store Operators](/assets/operation_center/playbooks/store_operator.png){: style="max-width:60%"}

To configure your modification, you need to fill 3 fields :

- `key` - The key will be used to retrieve the data in another module or to edit it in another store.
- `type` - The type correponds to the action you want to do.
- `value` - The value of the data.

#### Retrieve data from the store

To retrieve information from the store in a module, you need to specify the key associated to it.

**Example**:

To retrieve the list of IPs stored in the key `ip`: use `{{ store.ip }}`.

#### Types of store

4 types are available within a `Store`:

- `set`: to set a value for the specified key.
- `unset`: to unset the value of the specified key.
- `append`: to store the value in a list referenced by the key. If the list does not exist, it is created, otherwise the value is appended to it.
- `remove`: to remove a value from a list referenced by the key.

#### Access a key from a store in another module

To access a key from a store in another module: use `{{ store.name_of_the_key }}`.
