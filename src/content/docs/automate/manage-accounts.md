# Manage accounts

You can centralize the management of your accounts to your third-party tools in the "Accounts" menu.

This allows you to re-use these accounts between your multiple playbook actions without having to copy and paste this information.


## Create a new account

- Click ```Accounts > New accounts``` and select a service.
- Enter your credentials and save

## How to use your accounts

Once your account has been created, you can use it (and reuse it) in every node configuration.
