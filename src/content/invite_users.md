# Invite users to join your community

To invite users to your community, you need to send them invitations through the User Center. You can invite as many users as needed if you have [the role](/manage_users/#needed-role-and-permissions) `manage_member`. 

However, depending on the [type of community](/getting_started/create_community.md) you are in, the invitation process can differ. 

In this documentation, you will learn how to add users in these communities.

## Add new users to a community

### In a managed community

To invite new users to a managed community:

1. Click on your avatar on the upper right side of the screen and select `Managed Communities`
2. On the tab `Users`, click on the `+ User` button
3. Type in the `user’s email` and select the `community` you want to invite them in
4. Select `roles` you want to attribute to your guest. You can either select the default ones or create custom roles based on chosen permissions. Check this documentation to learn how to create custom roles. 
5. Once you’re done, press `Validate` and wait for your guest to accept the invitation

### In an MSSP community

An MSSP community is one main community with multiple managed communities inside of it. The admin of an MSSP community can access all of the managed communities.

You can either invite users to join the main MSSP community or invite them to one or more managed communities inside the MSSP community. 

#### In the main MSSP community

To add users to the main MSSP community: 

1. Click on your avatar on the upper right side of the screen and select `Managed Communities`
2. On the tab `Users`, click on the `+ User` button
3. Type in the `user’s email` and select the MSSP community (the first one in the list) 
4. Select `roles` you want to attribute to your guest. You can either select the default ones or create custom roles based on chosen permissions. Check this documentation to learn how to create custom roles. 
5. Once you’re done, press `Validate` and wait for your guest to accept the invitation

The invited user will have access to the main MSSP community as well as all other managed communities inside of it. 

#### In an MSSP managed community

If you need the invited user to access only some managed communities within the MSSP community, invite them to only some specific communities. 

To add users to some managed communities within a main MSSP community: 

1. Click on your avatar on the upper right side of the screen and select `Managed Communities`
2. On the tab `Users`, click on the `+ User` button
3. Type in the `user’s email` and select communities you want to invite your user in
4. Select `roles` you want to attribute to your guest. You can either select the default ones or create custom roles based on chosen permissions. Check this documentation to learn how to create custom roles. 
5. Once you’re done, press `Validate` and wait for your guest to accept the invitation

The invited user will only have access to the selected MSSP managed communities, but not the main MSSP community.
