## Representation

In the events, Sekoia.io accepts any representation of a datetime:

- as a string representation:
	- [ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) representation
	- [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.html) representation
	- [C-formatted datetime representation](#c-formatted) in the English locale
- as a timestamp representation with any precision (from second precision to nanosecond precision)

### C formatted

The following is a list of all the format codes that the C89 standard requires.
These work on all platforms with a standard C-based implementation.

| Directive   | Meaning                                                          | Example                                      |

## Timezone 

The datetime must satisfy one of the following conditions:

- a string representation with a timezone (like ISO8601 or RFC3339 strings)
- a string representation or a timestamp representation together with a timezone in the event
- a string representation or a timestamp representation in the UTC timezone
