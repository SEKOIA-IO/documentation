## Your account have been deactivated

If your account has been deactivated and you need to reconnect to the platform, contact your community's admin as they are the ones who can [reactivate your account](#how-to-reactivate-an-account). 

After your account has been reactivated, it's essential to re-authenticate your account by logging in **at least once before midnight on the same day.** If you do not log in within this time frame, your account will be deactivated again.
