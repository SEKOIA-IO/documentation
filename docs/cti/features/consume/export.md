# Data Export

When on an Object's page or when looking at a Report, you can export related items directly from the application and download them in the CSV or JSON format.

The export modal lets you to select:

* If you want to export all relationships or select a specific type
* The format of the created file (CSV, TXT, JSON and MITRE ATT&CK)

The CSV format will convert some values (such as the TLP, sources and kill chain phases) to a human-readable format instead of IDs.

The MITRE ATT&CK format can be used in the MITRE ATT&CK® Navigator (https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/) to generate a more visual ATT&CK matrix.
