# Filtering

Many API methods accept filtering and matching parameters. A client can request specific content from the SEKOIA.IO API by specifying a set of filters.

## Match

The `match[<field>]` field parameter can be used to filter documents given the value of a specific `field`. A filter parameter can be specified any number of times, where all filter fields are ANDed together. 

It should be noted that each `field` must not occur more than once. Multiple values of a match parameter are separated by a comma (U+002C COMMA, “,”) without any spaces. If multiple values are present, the match is treated as a logical OR.

**Examples of match parameters**

```
# list alerts triggered on entity entity1 or entity2
/alerts?match[entity_name]=entity1,entity2

# list alerts triggered on entity1 with rule named rule1 or rule2
/alerts?match[entity_name]=entity1&match[rule_name]=rule1,rule2
```
