# Authentication

The app is accessible through the URL [app.sekoia.io](http://app.sekoia.io). You’ll have to enter your email and password then hit Login.

We highly recommend using **2-factor authentication** to add a layer of security to your account. You can either use an Authentication app or a security token.

In case your forgot your password, you can hit the `Forgot password link` on the login page, enter your email address and wait until we send you a confirmation link to reset your password shortly after.

You can find the necessary documentation to set up the required security on this **page**.
