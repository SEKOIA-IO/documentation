# Join a Community
To access Sekoia.io, you’ll need to either have an existing account or be invited in a community by someone who already has an account and the right permissions to add people.

When invited to join a community, you’ll receive an invitation email with a link.

Click on the `Join your new community` button and follow the [account creation](create_account.md) steps to create your account.

!!! note
    Sometimes, the email is redirected to spams. Check your spams in case you don’t receive this invitation.
