# Create your account

To create your new account, you will have to click on the link in the invitation email and you'll be redirected to the account creation form.

From there, you'll have to:

1. Provide your full name
2. Set a strong password
3. Agree to the Terms of Service

Once your account is created, you land in the User Center which is the place where you can setup your account, add layers of security and privacy, set notifications, manage your communities, manage API Keys and manage your users (with an [Admin role](https://docs.sekoia.io/getting_started/roles/#functionality-of-built-in-roles)).

The User Center is accessible by clicking on your avatar on the upper right part of the screen then on any pages (`<Your full name>`, `Account`, `Notifications` or `Community Settings`). 

Learn more about navigation on the platform in the following sections of **Getting Started**.
