## Edit a community

To edit a community's name and description, you need to have the [right permissions](https://docs.sekoia.io/getting_started/roles/#legacy-roles) (e.g. permissions of `manage_community` role) 

1. Go to the **Managed community**’s main page by clicking on your Profile (top right) then **Community settings**
2. Click on the `Edit` button next to the community’s name 
3. From there, you can change the name, the description, the website and the image of the community.
4. Save your changes


### Add an image

Being able to recognize your managed communities can be important, especially when you enable rules, filter your events or sort alerts. 

One way to go is to add a profile image to the community. To do so: 

1. Go to the **Managed community**’s main page by clicking on your Profile (top right) then **Community settings**
2. Click on the cercle next to the community’s name 
3. Upload an image by dragging it in the area or by uploading it from your machine 
4. Save your changes

Your managed community is now recognizable. You can also hover over the image to see your community’s name.
