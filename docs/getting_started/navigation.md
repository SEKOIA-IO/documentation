# Navigation on the Platform

## Authentication

The app is accessible through the URL [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/). You’ll have to enter your email and password then hit Login.

We highly recommend using [2-factor authentication](account_security.md) to add a layer of security to your account. You can either use an Authentication app or a security token.

In case your forgot your password, you can hit the “Forgot password link” on the login page, enter your email address and wait until we send you a confirmation link to reset your password shortly after.

!!! note
    You can find the necessary documentation on how to set up the required security on this [page](account_security.md).

## User Interface

Once you are logged in to [app.sekoia.io](https://app.sekoia.io/) and no matter which product you are subscribed to, you will have access to UI elements that were carefully designed to make your user experience more fluid on the platform.

In this section, you’ll learn how to navigate the platform with ease.

### **App toolbar**

The app toolbar is made of multiple components:

- The `Sekoia.io logo` that redirects you to the main page (dashboards) when you click on it
- Your current `community’s name` with the possibility to have a look into your other communities
- An `info button` that lets you have an easy access to the roadmap, product documentation, changelog and feedbacks
- A `notification bell` from where you can access the latest notifications you’ve received
- Your `avatar` that lets you have access to the contextual menu that is detailed in the next section

### **Contextual menu**

The contextual menu, accessible by clicking on your avatar in the top right of the screen, gives you access to:

- Your account settings
- Your notifications manager
- Your managed communities
- A way to log out of the app

### **Community switch**

In the app toolbar, you can easily access your current community as well as other communities you’re part of.

By clicking on the dropdown, you can:
