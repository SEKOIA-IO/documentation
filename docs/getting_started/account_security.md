# Set up account security
## Two-factor authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security for your Sekoia.io account by introducing an additional step during the login process. In addition to your username and password (aka credentials), you will be required to provide a 6-digit verification code generated on your phone. This ensures enhanced protection against unauthorized access to your account.

## How do I enable two-factor authentication?

### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

To enhance the security of your Sekoa.io account, you can enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) by following these instructions:

1. Begin by logging in to app.sekoia.io using your credentials
2. Click on your profile picture in the top right of the screen. From the dropdown menu, select `Account settings` to access the User Center
3. Within your Account page, scroll down until you find the section labeled `Register Two-Factor Authentication`. Click on the `Enable` button associated with it
4. You will be asked to enter your password for verification purposes
5. Follow the steps below to complete the setup process for 2FA on your account:
   1. Visit either the App Store (for iOS) or the Google Play (for Android) to download and install an Authenticator app such as Lastpass, Authenticator, or Authy. Follow the instructions provided by the app to set up an account
   2. Use the authentication app you installed to either scan the QR code displayed on app.sekoia.io or manually enter the token provided
   3. Enter the `6-digit code` generated by the authentication app
6. Lastly, ensure that you generate and securely save your backup codes. These codes serve as a backup method to access your account in case you are unable to use the authentication app

### Generate recovery codes

When you cannot use your authenticator app (e.g. changed phone / phone lost), you can use recovery codes provided by Sekoia.io to access your account. **Ten backup codes** are generated. 

When enabling two-factor authentication, backup codes are generated automatically and you can either `copy` them or `download` them as a text file.

You can also generate new backup codes but keep in mind that your old codes will not work anymore.

We recommend you print off and store your codes in a safe location.

!!! Note
   Each code can only be used **once**.

### Log in with backup codes

To log in with your backup codes, you will need to:

1. Locate your backup codes
2. Sign into app.sekoia.io
3. Enter your `username` and `password`
4. When asked for your verification code, enter the backup code and select `verify`

### How to disable two-factor authentication

To disable two-factor authentication on your Sekoia account:

1. Log in to app.sekoia.io
2. Click on your profile picture and select `Account settings` to access the User center
3. In your Account page, scroll down to the section `Register Two-Factor Authentication` and click on `Enable`
4. Enter your current password and select `disable`
