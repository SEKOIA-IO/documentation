WebAuthn standard (Web Authentication) is supported in Sekoia.io as we value high security standards. Users can use multiple tools to access their account in the fastest and most secure way possible. These security tokens can be used as a second factor of authentication instead of a verification code.

Depending on your web browser, you can use different types of security tokens to connect to the platform. These tokens can be `physical` (a USB security key) or `embedded` in your machine (fingerprint authentication). The platform supports [FIDO2-compliant authenticators](https://fidoalliance.org/certification/authenticator-certification-levels/) including security keys, Touch ID, Face ID and [Windows Hello](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learn-about-windows-hello-and-set-it-up-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0).
