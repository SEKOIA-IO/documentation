To comply with [PCI/DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) requirements, users who have been inactive for 90 days must be deactivated. This means that if a user has not logged in or engaged in any activity on the platform within the past 90 days, their community membership will be disabled.

## How to deactivate inactive accounts?

If you need to deactivate inactive accounts on your workspace, follow these steps: 

1. Go to Settings page > Workspace Security 
2. Find the section `Deactivate inactive accounts`
3. Enable the toggle `On/Off` and click on `Confirm`

!!! tip 
    You can see deactivated accounts in your list of users through the tab `Users`. Their status will be marked as `Deactivated`. To list only deactivated accounts, use the **Filter by Status > Deactivated**.

## How to reactivate an account?

If you need to reactivate a deactivated account, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings page > Workspace users 
2. Locate the deactivated user's name and click the ellipsis `"..."` button on the right-hand side. You can use the `Filter by Status` and select `Deactivated` to list only deactivated accounts 
3. Choose the `Reactivate` option and confirm your choice

!!! note
    Please note that only admins have the right permissions to reactivate accounts. Additionally, the reactivated user must re-authenticate their account **at least once before midnight** **on the same day**. If they fail to do so within this time frame, their account will be deactivated again.

## Your account have been deactivated

If your account has been deactivated and you need to reconnect to the platform, contact your workspace admin as they are the ones who can [reactivate your account](#how-to-reactivate-an-account). 

After your account has been reactivated, it's essential to re-authenticate your account by logging in **at least once before midnight on the same day.** If you do not log in within this time frame, your account will be deactivated again.
