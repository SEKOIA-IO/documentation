# Overview

MSSP community with multiple managed communities: for MSSP partners with SOC/CERT activities
Sub-community creation is only available on MSSP mode only

## Create a new sub-community

For the managed community with multiple entities, our support team will handle the creation of the community and assist you to add the necessary [entities](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/entities/). 

However, for the MSSP community, the support team can create the main MSSP community. 

Users with the [right permissions](https://docs.sekoia.io/getting_started/roles/#legacy-roles) (e.g. permissions of `manage_community` role) can add multiple communities from the user interface. 

To create a managed community in an MSSP environment:

1. Go to the **Managed community**’s main page by clicking on your Profile (top right) then **Community settings**
2. On the right panel, you’ll find a list of all managed communities within the main MSSP community. Click on the button `+ Community`
3. Provide a name, a description and a link to a website (optional) 
4. Save

Your newly created community now appears in the listing of your managed communities.
