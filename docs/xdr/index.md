# Sekoia Defend (XDR)

Sekoia Defend (XDR) is **an eXtended Detection and Response platform** that automates your SOC.

It allows you to easily integrate and analyze the events produced by your applications, endpoints, cloud and SaaS perimeters in real time, and we designed it with the sole purpose of protecting your assets from potential cyber threats.

## Product Features

### Detect

Sekoia.io combines Cyber Threat Intelligence, anomaly detection and advanced Threat detection scenarios to effectively detect attacks, intrusions and compromises. By design, Sekoia.io is built to protect your organization against the most aggressive and advanced threats.

1. Discover the [Rules Catalog](features/detect/rules_catalog.md).
2. Create your [own detection rules](features/detect/sigma.md).

### Investigate

Sekoia Defend (XDR) allows you to conduct investigations on malicious activities directly from an alert or by means of the event history.
Case management makes it possible to reconcile alerts with each other and to document the associated analyzes and results.

2. Hunt down the intruders with the [Event History](features/investigate/events.md) and its drill down capabilities.
3. Use [Case Management](features/investigate/cases.md) to centralize your observations on an incident and collaborate with other stake holders.

### Automate

Automating your security improves your cybersecurity operations by consolidating your procedures. SOC Automation combines security tools, processes and people to accelerate the execution of your security responses while ensuring their repeatability and auditability.

- Manage your [Playbooks](features/automate/index.md) to automate your SOC.

### Report

- Review your Security with dedicated [Dashboards](features/report/dashboards.md) or build your own control center.

### Reveal (Asset Visibility & Inventory)

Reveal is an add-on module that continuously discovers, **unifies**, and contextualizes your assets (hosts, accounts, networks). It merges data from **third-party asset inventories**, **vulnerability management** tools, the **Sekoia Endpoint Agent** and **passive asset identication** through analysis of intakes into a single, unified Asset Inventory.  

Each asset is enriched with a **Timeline**, **Hygiene** posture, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Points of Interest**. Open the **Asset Context Panel** from **Alerts**, **Cases**, **Events**, or **Assets** to see identity, activity, and risk in place â€” speeding up triage and decisions.  

#### Get started
1. **Connect sources:** Deploy the [Sekoia Endpoint Agent](https://docs.sekoia.io/integration/categories/endpoint/sekoiaio/#enabling-host-hygiene-collection) and integrate your [asset inventory](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/integrations_hub/) and [vulnerability management](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/integrations_hub/) tools.  
2. **Curate inventory:** Assign **criticality**, **tags**, and owners; resolve duplicates and address coverage gaps through your [asset inventory](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/assets/#your-asset-inventory).  
3. **Investigate:** Use the Asset Context Panel (coming soon)
) anywhere to act on context.
