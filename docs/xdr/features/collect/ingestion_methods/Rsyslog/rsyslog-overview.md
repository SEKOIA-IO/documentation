Many technologies and agents allow the forwarding of their logs using the syslog protocol (RFC 5426).

We recommend you centralize them on a dedicated server: Rsyslog.

Before processing, you have to:

- Connect to [SEKOIA.IO Operations Center](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/)
- Add an Intake to the relevant Entity
- Keep trace of the automatically generated Intake key
