Sekoia.io supports the following log collectors:

- Syslog over TLS (`intake.sekoia.io:10514`): forward your events with the Syslog protocol specified in RFC 5424.
- RELP over TLS (`intake.sekoia.io:11514`): forward your events with Rsyslogâ€™s reliable protocol called RELP.
- HTTPS (`https://intake.sekoia.io`): `POST` your JSON events to Sekoia.io.
- Cloud hosting and API polling: configure Sekoia.io to regularly retrieve your logs.

If these solutions do not meet your needs, contact our support.

## Syslog integration

We provide documentation and example configurations on how to configure your log system for Rsyslog, but it should be easy to configure other log collectors to forward their events to Sekoia.io.

## HTTPS integration

To push your events through our HTTP log collector, you have to `POST` your logs in the JSON format. To send us events, you should set `Content-Type` HTTP header to `application/json`.

## Cloud & SaaS integration

Sekoia.io is also able to retrieve logs and data from cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud.
