With this capability, your integration possibilities are now boundless. Build your own playbook actions, triggers, connectors, intake formats, and more.

### Pre-requisites

To create a custom integration in Sekoia.io, you will need:

- Python version 3.11 or newer
- Your favorite IDE

### Steps to create your custom integration

1. **Install Sekoia.io Automation SDK**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command `pip install sekoia-automation-sdk`
2. **Initialize the integration**: Create an empty integration code folder using this command line. The `modules` path should be the directory where you want to store your integration: `sekoia-automation new-module modules`
3. **Develop your integration**: From here, dive into our comprehensive developer documentation to build out the functionalities of your integration.

Once your development is complete, proceed to import your integration. Your custom integration will then be ready to use!

### How to import your integration

Connect and sync your GitHub or GitLab repository to import your integration once your code is ready.

- **If your repository is private:** You will need to allow Sekoia.io repository access by adding our public SSH key to your Git provider's settings.
    - **For GitHub:** Navigate to `Settings` > `Deploy keys`.
    - **For GitLab:** Go to `Settings` > `Repository` > `Deploy keys`.
- **Connect your repository:** Enter your repository URL in the designated field and click `Connect` to test the connection.

Once you've connected your repository and initiated the import, the platform automatically performs a series of checks on your integration's code. If all pre-requisites and development steps are successfully accomplished, indicated by a "green check" status, your custom integration will be officially created within Sekoia.io. At this point, it will become accessible from the main Integrations Catalog listing and can be used just like any other pre-built integration.
