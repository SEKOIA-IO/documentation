## Configure

### Prerequisites

To forward events to Sekoia.io, create [an Event hub namespace and an Event hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create) with a consumergroup.

Once created, in your EventHubs, go to `Setting > Shared access policies`.
Create a new policy with the option `Listen` then copy the `Connection string-primary key`.

Create a [Storage accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create) or use an existing one. Go to `Data storage > containers` and create a new container.
Then go to `Security + networking > Access keys` and copy the key1 `Connection string`.

Configure Microsoft Intune door to stream its logs to the EventHub with [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/review-logs-using-azure-monitor).

## Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format Microsoft Intune.

### Pull events

Go to the [playbook page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/playbooks) and create a new playbook with the [Consume Eventhub messages](../../../automate/library/microsoft-azure.md#consume-eventhub-messages). 

Set up the trigger configuration with the EventHub's `Connection string-primary key`, the hub name, the consumer group, the storage's `Connection string-primary key` and the container name.

Start the playbook and enjoy your [events](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/events).
