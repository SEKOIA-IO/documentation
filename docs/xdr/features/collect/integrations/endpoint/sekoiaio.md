# Sekoia.io Endpoint Agent

Sekoia.io provides its own agent allowing to collect interresting events with a minimal configuration overhead. This agent sends events directly to Sekoia.io.

### Disclaimer

!!! INFO
    The Sekoia.io Endpoint Detection Agent preserves the integrity of logs collected from the operating system event log, it does NOT modify or rewrite logs.

## Supported OS versions

The Endpoint Detection Agent supports the following operating systems, **on 64 bits version only**:

=== "Windows"

    * Windows 8
    * Windows 10
    * Windows 11
    * Windows server 2016
    * Windows server 2019
    * Windows server 2022

=== "Linux"

    Linux distributions based on a kernel version of **3.10** or newer should be supported by the agent.

    Here's a non-exhaustive list of supported distributions:

    * Ubuntu 14.04 and newer
    * Debian 8 and newer
    * CentOS 7 and newer
    * Redhat 7 and newer

## Prerequisites
The Sekoia.io Endpoint Agent uses the HTTPS protocol to send its events and has an automatic update mechanism. Therefore, it is necessary to open the following streams:

=== "FRA1"

    * https://intake.sekoia.io/
    * https://api.sekoia.io/

=== "FRA2"
    * https://fra2.app.sekoia.io/

=== "MCO1"
    * https://mco1.app.sekoia.io/



## Installation

### Disclaimer

!!! Warning
	If you want to install this agent on a machine that already has an EDR in place, be aware that most EDR perform actions on the machines to detect malwares or other types of threats. Those actions generate events that are collected by our agent. This may result to the raising of false positive alerts from our detection rules of effort level 3 and 4. It's important for customers to fine-tune these rules to reduce the occurrence of false positives.

### Step 1: Create an intake

The first step to use the agent is to create a [new intake associated to the Sekoia.io Agent](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes/new?match[name]=Sekoia.io%20Endpoint%20Agent){:target="_blank"}.

### Step 2: Download executable

| OS | Link |
| -- | -- |
| Windows | [https://app.sekoia.io/api/v1/xdr-agent/download/agent-latest.exe](https://app.sekoia.io/api/v1/xdr-agent/download/agent-latest.exe) |
|Linux | [https://app.sekoia.io/api/v1/xdr-agent/download/agent-latest](https://app.sekoia.io/api/v1/xdr-agent/download/agent-latest) |


### Installation

The Endpoint Detection Agent is easy to install on Windows or Linux systems once you created a dedicated intake key on Sekoia.io XDR.

=== "Windows"

    The following commands must be executed **as an administrator**:

    ```shell
    agent.exe install --intake-key <INTAKE_KEY>
    ```

    To make sure the agent has been successfully installed as a service you can run the following command:

    ```shell
    Get-Service SEKOIAEndpointAgent
    ```

=== "Linux"

    If `auditd` is running on the machine you must disable it before installing the linux agent:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl stop auditd
    # In case of error "Failed to stop auditd.service: Operation refused"
    # try to set "RefuseManualStop" to "no" inside "/usr/lib/systemd/system/auditd.service"
    # reload the systemctl daemon "sudo systemctl daemon-reload"
    # and retry "sudo systemctl stop auditd"
    sudo systemctl disable auditd
    ```

    !!! note
    	It is very important that the auditd service is **stopped** for the agent to work properly. The disable command is used to allow persistence of the configuration.  

    Now that `auditd` is disabled you can install the agent:

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./agent-latest
    sudo ./agent-latest install --intake-key <INTAKE_KEY>
    ```

    To make sure the agent has been successfully installed as a service you can run the following command:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl status SEKOIAEndpointAgent.service
    ```

Once installed, the agent collects event logs, normalizes them and sends them to Sekoia.io. The protocol used to send events is HTTPS (443).

#### journald configuration

In order to get events, the agent pushes rules to the audit framework. By default **journald**  might listen to the audit socket for events.

To disable audit logging the following should be done as root:
	
       
	# Stop listening to audit events
	systemctl stop systemd-journald-audit.socket 
	
	# Disable it to avoid future start
	systemctl disable systemd-journald-audit.socket
	
	# Masking will prevent starting by other services
	systemctl mask systemd-journald-audit.socket
	
	# Restart journald
	systemctl restart systemd-journald
       
       
A reboot may be necessary if the audit events are still appearing in the logs.

#### Setting the region

When installing the agent it is possible to specify the region the agent will communicate with. 
To do it simply append `--region <region_name>` at the end of the command. 

For example if the agent must communicate with `fra2` the following command can be executed:

```shell
agent.exe install --intake-key <INTAKE_KEY> --region fra2
```

### Update

#### Disable automatic update

By default, the agent will update itself automatically. If you would like to disable this feature, the flag `--disable-auto-update` must be specified during the installation.

#### Manual update

To manually update the agent, follow the instructions specific to your OS:

=== "Windows"

    The following command must be executed **as an administrator**:

    ```shell
    $ProgramFiles\EndpointAgent\agent.exe update
    ```

    Where `$ProgramFiles` refers to the path to the `Program Files` folder, usually `c:\Program Files`.

=== "Linux"

    The following command must be executed:

    ```shell
    sudo /opt/endpoint-agent update
    ```


### Uninstall

To uninstall the agent, follow the instructions specific to your OS.

#### Since version 0.3.0

=== "Windows"

    In order to completely uninstall the agent on Windows the command must be executed using a copy of the running executable.
    You can either:

    * Download the latest version of the agent and use this binary to perform the uninstall
    * Copy the running agent located at `$ProgramFiles\EndpointAgent\agent.exe` 
      * `$ProgramFiles` refers to the path to the `Program Files` folder, usually `c:\Program Files`)

    The following command must be executed **as an administrator**:

    ```shell
    agent.exe uninstall
    ```

=== "Linux"

    The following command must be executed:

    ```shell
    sudo /opt/endpoint-agent/agent uninstall
    ```

#### For versions prior to 0.3.0

=== "Windows"

    The following commands must be executed **as an administrator** to remove the service:

    ```shell
    agent.exe -service stop
    agent.exe -service uninstall
    ```

    The folders created by the agent must then be removed:

      * `$ProgramFiles\EndpointAgent`
        * Where `$ProgramFiles` refers to the path to the `Program Files` folder, usually `c:\Program Files`
      * `$ProgramData\EndpointAgent`
        * Where `$ProgramData` refers to the path to the `ProgramData` folder, usually `c:\ProgramData` 

=== "Linux"

    The following commands must be executed to remove the service:

    ```shell
    sudo /opt/endpoint-agent/agent -service stop
    sudo /opt/endpoint-agent/agent -service uninstall
    ```

    The folders created by the agent must then be removed:

    ```shell
    sudo rm -rf /opt/endpoint-agent
    sudo rm -rf /etc/endpoint-agent
    ```

## Collect logs in files

!!! WARNING
    This feature is currently in beta.

!!! INFO
    This feature allows you to monitor and collect logs from applications such as NGINX. For all system-related events, the agent automatically collects these logs without you having to do a thing.
    

The agent offers to send to Sekoia.io logs contained in files.

If you want to enable this feature, follow these steps: 

1. Edit the configuration file at:
	
	=== "Windows"
	
	    ```
	    C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Sekoia.io\EndpointAgent\config.yaml
	    ```
	
	=== "Linux"
	
	    ```
	    /etc/endpoint-agent/config.yaml
	    ```

2. Add the following configuration:
	
	```yaml
	logfiles:
	    - filepath: /var/log/nginx/access.log  # Path to the file to watch
	      intakekey: {intake key}  # Intake key to use to send the events
	```

!!! WARNING
    It is important to use an intake key from a format that matches the content of the log file.

    i.e. To watch NGINX access logs we must have a intake key from the NGINX format.

Once the configuration file has been modified, the agent must be restarted:

=== "Windows"

    The following command must be executed **as an administrator**:

    ```
    Restart-Service SEKOIAEndpointAgent
    ```

=== "Linux"

    The following command must be executed:

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart SEKOIAEndpointAgent.service
    ```

## Retention

The agent sends the host logs through the internet. If the host stops accessing the internet, the agent will store the logs locally on disk on a 100 MB memory space that cannot be customized. Once the logs exceed the size of the buffer, the older ones are replaced by newers. When the internet connexion is operational again, the older logs are sent first to Sekoia.io.

## Events examples

Here's a non-exhaustive list of kind of events the agent is able to detect

=== "Windows"

    * Files creation/deletion/rename
    * Process lifecycle
    * Remote thread execution
    * DNS Resolution
    * TCP connection
    * Powershell commands
    * WMI Activity
    * NTLM
    * Windows Defender events
    * Sysmon events if configured
    * ...

=== "Linux"

    * Root commands executions
    * Files creation/deletion/rename/change
    * Process lifecycle
    * TCP connection
    * Python/Perl commands
    * PIP/APT installs
    * Cron configuration & scheduled jobs
    * Sudoers file changes
    * Passwd operations
    * Suspicious activity (curl, wireshark, …)
    * ...

    


## Proxy Support

If needed, the Sekoia.io agent can use a proxy server for its HTTPS requests. 
If you want to enable this feature, follow these steps: 

1. Edit the configuration file at:
	
=== "Windows"
	
     ```
     C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Sekoia.io\EndpointAgent\config.yaml
     ```
	
=== "Linux"
	
     ```
     /etc/endpoint-agent/config.yaml
     ```

2. Add the following line:

    ```
    HTTPProxyURL: "<PROXY_URL>"
    ```

If you want to automate the installation of the agent with this configuration option, make sure that a `config.yaml` file with this line is present in the working directory before launching the install command.

The proxy URL should follow the format `http://user:pass@host:port`.

## Optional steps

=== "Windows"

    #### Install Sysmon

    You have the ability to collect additional events with using Sysmon. When installed, the Sekoia.io Agent will automatically collect logs produced by Sysmon if they are not already collected by the agent.

    !!! warning
    	The installation of this tool will generate more logs which will consume more CPU resources. Install it on equipment that are correctly 		dimensioned, or try it on low risk assets at first.

    Sysmon is a Microsoft tool downloadable from [microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).
    A common installation instruction and configuration file is available on [Florian Roth's GitHub](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml). This configuration is an updated (and maintained) version of the [SwiftOnSecurity's configuration](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), which can also be used.

    #### Configure Security log auditing

    A proper security log auditing configuration will allow the agent to collect various  interresting security related events.
    
    This document can be followed for an optimal configuration: [Configuring Security Log Audit Settings](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/EnableWindowsLogSettings/blob/main/ConfiguringSecurityLogAuditPolicies.md).


#### Ignore paths when computing file hashes

It is possible to specify paths the agent won't compute hashes for files located in it.

If you want to enable this feature, follow these steps: 

1. Edit the configuration file at:
	
	=== "Windows"
	
	    ```
	    C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Sekoia.io\EndpointAgent\config.yaml
	    ```
	
	=== "Linux"
	
	    ```
	    /etc/endpoint-agent/config.yaml
	    ```

2. Specify the paths to ignore under the `HashesExcludedPaths` attribute

    i.e.

    ```yaml
    HashesExcludedPaths:
      - C:\path\to\ignore
      - /path/to/ignore
    ```
Once the configuration file has been modified, the agent must be restarted:

=== "Windows"

    The following command must be executed **as an administrator**:

    ```
    Restart-Service SEKOIAEndpointAgent
    ```

=== "Linux"

    The following command must be executed:

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart SEKOIAEndpointAgent.service
    ```
