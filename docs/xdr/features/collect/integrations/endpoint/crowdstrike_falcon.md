## Configure

To retrieve the events produced by your Falcon instance, a playbook must be configured with the dedicated trigger "Trigger on Falcon Events". This trigger requires the following API information to connect on the Event Stream of CrowdStrike:

* the base URL of the API (e.g. https://api.eu-1.crowdstrike.com)
* a client identifier
* a client secret

!!!important
    Use the "API Client & Keys" CrowdStrike configuration panel to create an OAuth2 API client with the `Read` permission on scope `Event Stream` and `Detection`. For Threat Graph, please contact Crowdstrike Support to activate it and create the ID of the legacy Threat Graph API.
