## Configure

In this guide, you will configure your Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager or your Symantec Endpoint Security to forward events through syslog.

### Prerequisites

An internal syslog concentrator is required to collect and forward events to Sekoia.io.

### Enable Syslog forwarding

Log on the console of our management server and follow [this guide](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/symantec-security-software/endpoint-security-and-management/endpoint-protection/all/Monitoring-Reporting-and-Enforcing-Compliance/viewing-logs-v7522439-d37e464/exporting-data-to-a-syslog-server-v8442743-d15e1107.html) to enable logs forwarding and provide the IP, the transport protocol (we are recommending `TCP`) and the listening port (`514`) of the concentrator.

## Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format Symantec Endpoint Protection.


## Transport to Sekoia.io

Please consult the [Syslog Forwarding](../../../ingestion_methods/sekoiaio_docker_concentrator/) documentation to forward these logs to Sekoia.io.
