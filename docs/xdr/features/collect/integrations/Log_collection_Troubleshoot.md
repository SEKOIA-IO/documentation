# Facing issues with logs collection

Please find some general information that will help you to troubleshoot your logs collection

## General verification steps

### Configuration verification

1. Check that all pre-requisites are met
2. Configuration setup need to be done with admin permissions
3. Depending on the integration and ingestion method, a restart has to be done and delay might happen

### Collect issue

Please consult our documentation for each technology used

*Using a playbook connector*
1. Check the playbook logs
2. Check your account configuration (credentials, url...)
3. Check if the logs are generated on your technological platform

*Using a log concentrator*
1. Check the logs and send it to a local file for testing
2. Redo the installation following our documentation

   !!note
   When possible, we recommend using Sekoia.io Forwarder as it is simple and quick to use

### Parsing verification when in error

1. Check the field `sekoia.intake.parsing_error` in the events page
2. Compare events sent with the `Event Samples` of the intake documentation (expected log format)
3. For most intakes, it is possible to test through `intakes page > + new intake > <intake name>` and click on `See format`
![Intake parser access](/assets/operation_center/intakes/Intake_parser_access.png){: style="max-width:100%"}

4. Paste log and check the field `sekoia.intake.parsing_error`, please refer to [this section to test your log](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/intakes/#panel-overview)
