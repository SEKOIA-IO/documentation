### Creating the Github API key

To create an API key on [Github](https://github.com/):

1. On the top right corner, click on your profile picture then on `Settings`.
2. On the Developper Settings, create a Personnal access token (classic) with read access to the audit_logs.
3. Validate the configuration and save the token for the configuration of the connector.


### Create the intake in Sekoia.io

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format `Github  audit logs`. Copy the intake key.
