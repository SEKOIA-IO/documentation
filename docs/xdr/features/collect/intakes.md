# Intakes
Intakes correspond to data sources sent to Sekoia.io. They are identified by a name, a log format, an entity and an intake key.

You can configure as much intakes as you need in order to increase Sekoia.io knowledge of your infrastructure.

All features related to intakes are visible through the “Intakes” menu on the Operations Center.
## Intakes listing
The intakes homepage allows you to view the list of intakes already created within the community but also to create new intakes.

On this page, you can find:

- The created intakes in your community
- The entity associated with the intake
- The number of events sent to Sekoia.io for the past 7 days
- The number of events in error
- The intake key for each intake that you can copy directly from the table to your clipboard
- The creator as well as the creation date
- A delete button that implies the events produced by the intake will no longer be analyzed



## Create an intake from our integrations catalog
To configure a new source of events in your community, you can rely on our list of continuously growing integrations that are constantly developed and enhanced by Sekoia.io’s team.

!!! Note
    The documentation about the integration of your data sources is also available in the [integrations](integrations/index.md) page.

## Configure a notification to report on inactive intake
An inactive intake may have devastating consequences on your security monitoring. To prevent incidents from happening, you can set up notifications to get alerted when an intake stops sending events to Sekoia.io.

To set up your notification, you will have to:

1. Go to the Intakes listing page and click on:  ![Notification logo](/assets/operation_center/intakes/Monitor_intake_logo.png){: style="max-width:10%"} on the right side of the table
2. Specify how long the intake should be inactive before sending a notification. The duration can go from 15 min to 24 hours.
3. Select how you want to be notified. Triggered actions that are available are mentioned in the page [Turn on notifications](/getting_started/notifications-Listing_Creation).

!!! note
     You can also set up this notification from the User Center > Notifications by selecting the trigger `No events are received`.

## Notification when an intake is not receiving events

You can set a notification when an intake stops receiving events:

- On the Intake's page by clicking on the bell next to the delete button
- On the `Notifications` page of the User Center

- Intake
- Actions to perform:  Choose a channel where the notification will be sent
- Notification name
