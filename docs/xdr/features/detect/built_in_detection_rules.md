# Built-in detection rules

Sekoia.io provides built-in detection rules to illuminate intrusions, adversarial behaviours and suspicious activity escalation chains so you can immediately take steps to remediate. Built-in rules can be customized to your context and according to your security posture.

Please check the [dedicated FAQ page](../../FAQ/Detection_qa.md) related to detection rule strategy.

For Windows-related rules, Sekoia.io automatically produces [this regularly updated list](built_in_detection_rules_eventids.md) of the needed EventIDs by rule but also globally as some statistics are provided.
