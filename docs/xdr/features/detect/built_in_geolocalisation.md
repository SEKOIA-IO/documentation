# Built-in geolocalisation

Sekoia.io provides built-in IP geolocalisation with country FLAG and ASN code for all the IPs detected in a event.
This feature is based on data from [ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/).

Sekoia.io updates its data from ipinfo every three days, you may therefore experience temporary differences between the information from IPinfo and the data presented on the platform.
