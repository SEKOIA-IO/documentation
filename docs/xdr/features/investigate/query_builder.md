Currently, the following data sources are available:

* **Alerts**: Monitor and analyze security alerts.
* **Events**: Query raw telemetry and logs.
* **Cases**: Analyze investigation workflows and case management metrics.

Future updates will introduce more sources to expand your investigation capabilities.

## Query modes

The Query Builder provides two distinct ways to interact with your data:

* **Form mode**: A wizard-like interface using dropdowns and buttons. It is ideal for quick explorations and users unfamiliar with query languages.
* **Code mode (Default)**: A powerful editor using **SOL (Sekoia.io Query Language)**. This mode allows for maximum precision, complex filtering, and advanced logic that the wizard might not cover.

## Key use cases

* **Threat hunting**: Search for specific indicators of compromise across your telemetry.
* **Security analytics**: Aggregate logs to identify patterns or anomalies in user behavior.
* **Operational reporting**: Power your dashboards with real-time queries to track SOC performance.
