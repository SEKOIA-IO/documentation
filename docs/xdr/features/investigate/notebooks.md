## Overview
Notebooks is a powerful incident response feature that allows SOC analysts to centralize their `investigation queries`, `automation actions`, and `reporting` in a single document. With support for markdown syntax and rich media, Notebooks streamlines the incident response process and facilitates team collaboration.

## Getting Started with Notebooks

### Types of Notebooks
**Standalone Notebooks**

* Independent notebooks for general use (threat hunting, custom reporting)
* Accessible from the `Notebooks menu`

**Context-linked Notebooks**

* Attached to specific `cases` or `alerts` for incident response
* Directly accessible from the `Notebooks tab` within cases or alerts
* Provides centralized investigation context

### Basic Features
* Markdown syntax support
* Image attachment for evidence collection
* Multi datasources querying
* Investigation findings documentation
* Automations execution
* Real-time modifications saving

!!! Info
    Currently, Markdown table syntax is not supported.

* Malware analysis
* Intrusion containment
* Any custom threat responses

### Template Features

* Threat tailored query templates
* Suggested remediation actions
* Guidance for analysts

### Setting Default Notebook Template For Cases/Alerts
1. Navigate to Notebook templates
2. Select desired template
3. Set as `default` for cases and alerts

The `default` notebook template will be suggested for use in cases and alerts, enabling the SOC team to standardize their response processes.
