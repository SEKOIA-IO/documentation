# Events

The events page enables investigation in the latest events received by SEKOIA.IO using a log list, a search bar and multiple filters.

## Log list

The events page displays a list of the latest events received by [SEKOIA.IO](http://sekoia.io/).

A search is able to retrieve a maximum of 100 000 events, if this number is reached the search has to be narrowed.

The default columns are:

- `Timestamp`: Event date
- `Event.dialect`: Type of intake that sent the event
- `Description`: Smart description with clickable links formatted by [SEKOIA.IO](http://sekoia.io/) to show the most important elements and make them easily accessible, such as IP Address, Type or Name

It is possible to add or remove other columns using the  `Show fields`  tab by:

- Selecting the desired field in the `Available field` section using the "+" button
- Selecting the field to remove in `Selected fields` section using the "-" button
- Typing the desired field name in the `search bar` at the top of `Selected fields`

## Log lines

Each line of log can be unrolled to show:

- `Details`: Detailed information retrieved from the log about the event once parsed and elements related to the intake and community. These information can be used in the search bar
- `STIX`: Event as a STIX bundle that will be used by detection engines
- `Raw event`: Event as received by [SEKOIA.IO](http://sekoia.io/)

## Search bar

You can search among the list of events by using the `Dork Query Langage`. A complete documentation on how to use this langage is available [here](https://docs.sekoia.io/searching/dork/).

To go back to the list of logs shown, you need to clear filters and select "Current events"

It is possible to save a query by clicking on the star icon next to the search bar. The period of time is not saved with it.
To check it out, you can click on "Saved queries" then select the wanted period of time and press enter to see the events found.

### Date

Click on the `Apply` button to start your search based on these filters.

### Search history
