# Understanding Dashboards: Widgets, data, and Filters

Discover how Dashboards centralize your security data through Widgets and how to manipulate views using time ranges and refresh controls.

## What is a Dashboard?

Dashboards provide a powerful and intuitive way to visualize and monitor key metrics and data in real-time. Users can create customized views by combining various Widgets, offering insights into different aspects of their operations, security posture, or other critical areas.

### Default Dashboard
Accounts on Sekoia.io come with a preconfigured Dashboard that gives a synthetic view of the current community activity, either from:
* **Operational security perspective:** Risk Level, number of alerts, etc.
* **Activity perspective:** List of last posted comments, last created alerts, etc.

## The building blocks: Widgets

A key aspect of Dashboards is the ability to use **Widgets**. These are the individual containers that display data. There are two main types:

* **Built-in Widgets:** Pre-configured tools for common use cases (e.g., Risk Level, Top Threats).
* **Query Builder Widgets:** These enable users to create custom data queries directly within the Dashboard. This allows for highly tailored data analysis and visualization, empowering users to explore specific datasets.

## Interacting with data

### Filtering
By using filters, you can adjust the scope of an investigation—such as time range, entity, or process, without editing the underlying query logic.

### Time range configuration
The dashboard offers flexible options for configuring the time range for each widget and the overall dashboard.

### Refreshing data
The dashboard provides several options for refreshing the data presented in the widgets.

## Sharing Dashboards

Dashboards support collaboration between Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) and End Users.

* **For MSSPs:** Custom Dashboards can be shared with End Users directly during the creation or edition process.
* **For End Users:** Shared Dashboards are visible in the community. Users can view them, duplicate them for personalization, and inspect or run the underlying queries.
