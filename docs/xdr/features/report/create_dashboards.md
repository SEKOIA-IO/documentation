## Create a new Dashboard

You can easily create a new Dashboard directly from the Listing page:
1.  Click the **+ New Dashboard** button.

## Manage existing Dashboards

To perform the following actions, click the **(...) button** associated with any Dashboard in the list:

### Duplicate

### Delete
Select **Delete** to remove the Dashboard.

!!! warning 
   This will remove the Dashboard for **all members** of the community.

### Set as Homepage
Select **Set as Homepage** to make this Dashboard your default landing page.

* Every time you log in, you will land directly on this Dashboard.
* You can change your default homepage at any time.

## Managing time ranges

Managing the time range is essential for analyzing trends over specific periods. The Dashboard offers flexible options for configuring the time range for each Widget or the overall view.

### Dashboard date range
For Built-in Widgets, you can synchronize the time range with the overall Dashboard's date range.

* This is set using the **range selector** prominently displayed at the top of the Dashboard.
* Adjusting this selector updates all Built-in Widgets configured to follow the Dashboard's global date.

### Widget-specific time range
By default, each Widget can be configured to display data for its own specific time period.
* This allows for detailed analysis where different Widgets focus on different time frames simultaneously (e.g., real-time monitoring vs. 30-day trends).
* Each Widget clearly displays the time range it is currently using.

## Refreshing data

Ensuring that the data displayed is up-to-date is critical for accurate monitoring. By default, the Dashboard shows data computed during the last refresh.

### Manual refresh
To manually update data across all Widgets on the current Dashboard:

* Click the **Refresh** button located near the top of the Dashboard.
* The date and time of the last successful refresh are displayed next to the button.

!!! Note
   You can only trigger a manual refresh once every minute.

### Auto-refresh
If you prefer automated updates, you can enable the **Auto-refresh** option in the Dashboard settings.

* When enabled, all Widgets automatically refresh every **30 minutes**.
* This ensures your data stays current without manual intervention.
