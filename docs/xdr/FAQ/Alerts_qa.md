## Alert date and additional events

When an alert is triggered, additional events can enrich this alert but the date of the alert will not be updated (date= 1st trigger). 

## Alert and events timestamp relation

There are 4 valuable information available on SEKOIA.IO:
1- `log timestamp`:            Generated by the machine and present in the message (no actions done by SEKOIA.IO)
2- `collector timestamp` (if applicable):      Period when the log has been processed by the collector (timestamp collected from the endpoint available in the log unless it is missing so the timestamp of the header generated by the collector will be used instead)
3- `event.created`:            Period when the log has been arrived in SEKOIA.IO
4- `Alert date created`:       Period when the alert has been generated in SEKOIA.IO


The chronological time should be as follow (from old to recent):
`log timestamp (1) < collector timestamp (2)(if applicable) < event.created (3) < Alert created (4)`

!!! Troubleshoot tips
    Please check the different dates and collector configuration


## Bell icon in alerts page

The bell icon means that "the event is involved in an alert". 

When a bell on an event is displayed on an alert page, the event is involved in the current alert AND in another alert.

If it is involved in the current alert, the bell is not displayed.

## How an alert is triggered with a delay ?

Besides matching a rule in real time, an alert can be triggered with a delay when: 

    - An IOC is published, old events are scanned and if an event matches, the rule will automatically trigger an alert. 
    - Reingesting old logs
