## What happens when you add events to an alert? 
When you attach events to an alert, there are two mechanisms that are executed in parallel: alert generation and events externalisation.
Some latency might happen between alert generation and attaching events to an alert.

## Event search request on IP range
You can easily request an event search on IP range. For instance, with an IP address starting with 145, you can search by range as follow: `source.ip:[145.0.0.0 TO 145.255.255.255]`. 

## timestamp, event.created, event.start, event.end meaning

**timestamp** is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source lacks an original timestamp, this value is set up using the ingestion timestamp as a default. Events must be send to Sekoia.io in UTC.
**event.created** corresponds to Sekoia.io acknowledge timestamp. The timezone is defined with UTC.
**event.start**   contains the date when the event started or when the activity was first observed.
**event.end**   contains the date when the event ended or when the activity was last observed.

**event.start** & **event.end** are activity and monitoring of the event (Pre-Sekoia.io if not producedd by Sekoia.io)

`event.start` <= `event.end` <= `event.created`

## What is the timestamp based on?
The event timestamp is based on the event timestamp (when it's created in the machine), not on the ingestion timestamp in Sekoia.io.
