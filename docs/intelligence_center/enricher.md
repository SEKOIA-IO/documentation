# Enrichers

The Enrichers home page lists the status (pending, in progress, completed or failed) and results of observable enrichment tasks performed from the Observables page or from a Content Proposal. 
Filters allow you to sort by observable type, enricher or task status.

An Enricher is a module that allows you to enrich Observables via external services, either free (DNS and WHOIS) or paid (RiskIQ, VirusTotal, Censys, Shodan and BinaryEdge), to obtain more context (whois, VT score, etc.) or to generate new ones (passive DNS) as part of an investigation.
