# Intakes - Data Sources Management

# 🤔 What is an intake?

Intakes correspond to data sources sent to SEKOIA.IO. They are identified by a name, a log format, an entity and an intake key.

You can configure as much intakes as you need in order to increase SEKOIA.IO knowledge of your infrastructure.

All features related to intakes are visible through the “Intakes” menu on the Operations Center.

# 📄 Intakes Homepage

The intakes homepage allows you to view the list of intakes already created within the community but also to create new intakes.

On this page, you can find: 

- The created intakes in your community
- The entity associated with the intake
- The number of events sent to SEKOIA.IO for the past 7 days
- The number of events in error
- The intake key for each intake that you can copy directly from the table to your clipboard
- The creator as well as the creation date
- A delete button that implies the events produced by the intake will no longer be analyzed.
