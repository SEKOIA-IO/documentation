# Intakes - Data Sources Management

Intakes correspond to data sources sent to SEKOIA.IO. They are identified by a name, a log format and an 'intake key', which is used to configure the sending from your information system.

On the intake list, the number of events sent to SEKOIA.IO for the past 7 days and the number of events in error (not integrated) are displayed, as well as the intake key, with a button to copy this value to the clipboard.

To add a new intake, you will have to enter a name for it, choose the entity to which you want to associate the corresponding data and to choose the format of the events.
