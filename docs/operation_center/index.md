## What’s the Operations Center?

The Operations Center is **an eXtended Detection and Response SaaS platform** that leverages **Cyber Threat Intelligence** to combine **anticipation** with **automated incident response**.

It allows you to easily integrate and analyze the events produced by your systems in real time, and we designed it with the sole purpose of protecting your assets and entities from potential cyber threats. 

## Key Features

- A [dashboard](threat_exposition.md) with a wide range of widgets to provide you with an overall view of your systems’ health
- A [Rule's Catalog](rules_catalog.md) full of detection rules (588 to this day) and updated on a regular basis by SEKOIA.IO analysts.
- [Events](events.md), [Alerts](alerts.md) and [Cases](cases.md), three pages that let you investigate any potential threat to your infrastructure
- [Entities](entities.md),[Intakes](intakes.md) and [Assets](assets.md), each of them allow you to add, edit and configure the data sources you want to monitor.
