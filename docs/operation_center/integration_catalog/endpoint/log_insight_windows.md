## Configure

As of now, the main solution to collect Windows logs with Log Insight leverages the Rsyslog recipe. Please share your experiences with other recipes by editing this documentation.

### Rsyslog

Please refer to the documentation of Linux to forward events to your rsyslog server. The reader can consult the [Rsyslog Transport](../../../data_collection/ingestion_methods/rsyslog/) documentation to forward these logs to SEKOIA.IO.
