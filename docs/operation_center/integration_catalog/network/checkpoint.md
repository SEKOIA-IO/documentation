## Configure

As of now, the main solution to collect Checkpoint logs leverages the Rsyslog recipe. Please share your experiences with other recipes by editing this documentation.

We are currently supporting the following firewall versions: R77.30, R80.10, R80.20, R80.30.

### Rsyslog

Please refer to the documentation of the [Log Exporter](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk122323) of checkpoint to forward events to your rsyslog server. The reader is also invited to consult the [Rsyslog Transport](../../../data_collection/ingestion_methods/rsyslog/) documentation to forward these logs to SEKOIA.IO.
