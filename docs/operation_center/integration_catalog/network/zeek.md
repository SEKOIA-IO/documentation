## Overview
Zeek is a free and open-source software network analysis framework; it was originally developed in 1994 by Vern Paxson and was named in reference to George Orwell's Big Brother from his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. It can be used as a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) but with additional live analysis of network events. It is released under the BSD license.
