## Overview

This documentation details one way to collect and send FortiWeb logs to SEKOIA.IO: from the FortiWeb machine to an internal log concentrator (Rsyslog), then forwarded to SEKOIA.IO

{!operation_center/integration_catalog/generated/fortiweb_do_not_edit_manually.md!}

## Configure

On FortiWeb appliances, most of the important hardware and software activities that are relevant for security detection and analysis, are logged into three files.

- Traffic: Displays traffic flow information, such as HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses.
- Event: Displays administrative events, such as downloading a backup copy of the configuration, and hardware failures.
- Attack: Displays attack and intrusion attempt events.

### Transport to the concentrator

The following prerequisites are needed in order to setup efficient log concentration:
- Have administrator writes on the FortiWeb (read & write permission)
- Traffic towards the Rsyslog must be open on `UDP 514`

#### Configure FortiWeb

**Enable logging via trigger mechanism**

1. Go to `Log&Report > Log Config > Other Log Settings`
2. Tick the boxes : Enable Attack Log / Enable Traffic Log / Enable Event Log

**Configure Syslog policies**

1. Go to `Log&Report > Log Policy > Syslog Policy`.

> To access this part of the web UI, your administratorâ€™s account access profile must have Read and Write permission to items in the Log & Report category. For details, see Permissions.

2. Click `Create New`.

> If the policy is new, in Policy Name, type the name of the policy as it will be referenced in the configuration.

3. Click Create New.
4. In `IP Address`, enter the address of the remote Syslog server.
5. In `Port`, enter the listening port number of the Syslog server. The default is 514.
6. Click `OK`.

**Configure log destinations**

1. Go to `Log&Report > Log Config > Global Log Settings`
2. Tick the syslog box
3. Select the relevant Syslog Policy, Log Level and Facility
4. Click `Apply`

### Transport to SEKOIA.IO

#### Rsyslog

The reader is invited to consult the [Rsyslog Transport](../../../data_collection/ingestion_methods/rsyslog/) documentation to forward these logs to SEKOIA.IO.
