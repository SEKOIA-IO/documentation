## Configure

On Palo Alto appliances, most of the important hardward and software activities that are relevant for security detection and analysis, are logged into three files.

- Traffic: Local out traffic, Denied traffic, Allowed traffic
- System
- Security

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed in order to setup efficient log concentration:

- Have administrator priviledge on the Palo Alto
- Traffic towards the Rsyslog must be open on `TCP/514`

### Configure Palo Alto

#### Configure a Syslog server profile

1. In the GUI, go to `Device > Serve Profiles > Syslog`.
2. Click `Add` and enter a name for the profile such as `Syslog server`.
3. If the firewall has more than one virtual system (vsys), select the `Location` (vsys or `Shared`) where this profile is available.
4. Click `Add` and enter the information that the firewall requires to connect to it:

- Name — Unique name for the server profile.
- Syslog Server — IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the syslog server.
- Transport — Select TCP.
- Port — Select the default is TCP on port 514.
- Format — Select the syslog message format to use: IETF
- Facility — Select a syslog standard value (default is LOG_USER) to calculate the priority (PRI) field.

5. Click `OK` to save the server profile.

#### Configure syslog forwarding for Traffic logs

1. Select `Objects > Log Forwarding`, click `Add`, and enter a `Name` to identify the profile.
2. For each log type (here Traffic, Threat and WileFire Malicious) and each severity level, select the `Syslog server` profile and click `OK`.
3. Select `Policies > Security` and select a policy rule.
4. Select the `Actions` tab and select the `Log Forwarding` profile you created.
5. In the `Profile Type` drop-down, select `Profiles` or `Groups`, and then select the security profiles or `Group Profiles` required to trigger log generation and forwarding.
6. Select both of the `Log at Session Start` and `Log At Session End` check boxes, and click `OK`.

For detailed information about configuring a log forwarding profile and assigning the profile to a policy rule, see [Configure Log Forwarding](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/configure-log-forwarding.html#id1443a62b-8a0b-41db-a08d-5df934bf0ffc)

#### Configure syslog forwarding for System and User-ID logs

1. In the GUI, go to `Device > Log Settings`.
2. Click each Severity level (High and Critical if also fine), select the `Syslog server` profile, and click `OK`.

## Transport to SEKOIA.IO

Please refer to the documentation of the [Rsyslog Transport](../../../data_collection/ingestion_methods/rsyslog/) documentation to forward these logs to SEKOIA.IO.
