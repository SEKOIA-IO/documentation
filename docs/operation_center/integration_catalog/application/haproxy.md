## Overview
HAProxy is a free, open source software that provides a high availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications that spreads requests across multiple servers. HAProxy has a lot of features and because it is located between your infrastructure and your clients, it can give you a lot of information about either of them.

## Configure
As of now, the main solution to collect HAProxy logs leverages the Rsyslog recipe. Please share your experiences with other recipes by editing this documentation.

### Rsyslog

The reader is invited to consult the [Rsyslog Transport](../../../data_collection/ingestion_methods/rsyslog/) documentation to forward these logs to SEKOIA.IO.
