# Events Page

The events page diplays a list of latest events received by SEKOIA.IO. You can search among them by using Dork query langage, for which you can find more information [here](../searching/dork.md).

On the event page, you can access the raw format of your events, as received by SEKOIA.IO and the STIX format in which it is transformed.
