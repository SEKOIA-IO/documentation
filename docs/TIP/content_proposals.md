Content Proposals (CP) allow analysts to produce and capitalize on their own CTI. 

## Listing and filtering

The Content Proposals homepage lists all the contributions and suggestions made to add content to your TIP CTI database. 

### Types of Content Proposals

There are two types of content proposals: 

- CPs that are manually made by analysts
- CPs that are automatically pushed by playbooks

### Content Proposals statuses

A Content Proposal has three possible statuses. You can filter your CPs by status by clicking on one of the tabs. 

- Pending: the CPs are still being updated and have not been merged yet
- Merged: the CPs have been approved and their content is now part of the CTI database
- Rejected: the CPs have been rejected and their content has not been deployed in the database

### Available filters on Content Proposals

You can also filter your content proposals based on different filters: 

- The source of the CP
- The assigned analyst in charge of the CP
- The reviewed assigned to the CP

Each Content Proposal can be assigned to a member of your team and a reviewer. 

## Create an empty Content Proposal

In the listing page, the Create button allows you to create a new empty Content Proposal.

In the CP layout, in the left panel, you have access to different tabs.

### The Objects tab

The Objects tab allows you to: 

- Add existing objects from the CTI database to your CP
- Create new objects
- Create relationships (one by one or chain).

In this tab, you can display all the objects present in the Content Proposals and filter them by type, review status or whether or not objects have an associated warning. 

A button also allows multiple selection to perform different “bulk” actions such as adding existing relationships, creating new relationships or deleting objects.

### The Observables tab

The Observables tab allows you to:

- Create Observables individually
- Import Observables in bulk
- Assign tags to Observables
- Transform Observables into Indicators

A button also allows multiple selection to perform different “bulk” actions such as creating indicators from Observables, adding one or more tags or deleting Observables.

### The Relationships tab

The Relationships tab gives you the possibility to create relationships between two objects of the CTI database.

This phase of creating Objects and Relations can also be done directly in the Graph view.

## Import content to create a Content Proposal

To create a Content Proposal, you can also import content. 

There are three possible options to import content: 

- From a file
- From a free text
- From a URL

The imported content will be parsed in order to recognize as many Observables as possible (IP, domain names, file hash, e-mail address, URL, etc.) as well as objects already known to the CTI database (malware, intrusion set, attack pattern ATT&CK, location, etc.).
