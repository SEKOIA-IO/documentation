## Configure

### In Imperva interface

In your Imperva control panel, go to [Account > Account Management > SIEM Logs > WAF Log Setup](https://management.service.imperva.com/my/web-logs/settings).
Select Imperva API, CEF format and enable compression.
Copy the API ID, the API Key and the Log Server URI.

Then go to [SIEM Logs > Websites Logs Level](https://management.service.imperva.com/my/web-logs/sites-settings) and enable for each website the log level you want to get on Sekoia.io.

### Create the intake in Sekoia.io

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format Imperva WAF. Copy the intake key.

### Pull events

Go to the [playbook page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/playbooks) and create a new playbook with the [Imperva WAF logs trigger](../../../automate/library/imperva.md#imperva-waf-logs). You can use the existing template to fasten and ease the creation of your playbook.
Set up a new module configuration with the information you copied previously.
Set up the trigger configuration with the frequency of the pull.

At the end of the playbook, set up the action `Push events to intake` with a Sekoia.io API key and the intake key, from the intake previously created.

Start the playbook and enjoy your events.
