## Configure

### Prerequisites

To forward events produced by TEHTRIS EDR to Sekoia.io, you have to: 

1. Contact your TEHTRIS referent to activate the XDR Platform APIs for your tenant and ask to add the [Sekoia.io IP address](https://api.sekoia.io/outgoing-ips) to the allowlist

2. Log on the TEHTRIS XDR platform and navigate to `SOAR > Key Management`

3. Click on the button `Add`, enter the label of the API Key and select, at least, the API `Fetch Events`. You may have to create a filter
   
4. At the end, click on `Create` to generate the API Key

### Create the intake

To create the intake, go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format `TEHTRIS Endpoint Detection & Reponse`.

### Pull events

To start to pull events, you have to: 

1. Go to the [playbook page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/playbooks) and create a new playbook with the [Fetch new events from TEHTRIS](../../../automate/library/tehtris.md#fetch-new-events-from-tehtris) module
   
2. Set up the module configuration with your API key and your tenant ID (most of time, your tenant ID is the subdomain of your TEHTRIS instance; eg: `https://{tenant_id}.tehtris.net`)
  
3. Start the playbook and enjoy your [events](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/events)
