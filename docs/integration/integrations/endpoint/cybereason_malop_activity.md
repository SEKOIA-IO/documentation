## Configure

This setup guide will lead you into forwarding all MalOp activities to Sekoia.io.

### Create your intake

On Sekoia.io, go to the [Intakes page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes/new) and generate a new intake with the `Cybereason MalOp Activities` format.
Keep aside the intake key.

### Setup the Syslog collector

Check the [Syslog Forwarding](../../../ingestion_methods/sekoiaio_forwarder/) documentation to install and set up the syslog collector.

Once the setup has completed, write down the IP address and port. This information will be used in the next step.

### Setup the CybeReason CEF Forwarder

Contact the Cybereason Customer Success Manager to get the Cybereason CEF Forwarder.

Connect to the [Cybereason Partner Nest](https://nest.cybereason.com/user/login) and follow [these instructions](https://nest.cybereason.com/node/3517551) for the installation of the CEF forwarder.

Create a [new configuration](https://nest.cybereason.com/node/3517426) to forward MalOp activities to the syslog collector: fill `host` and `port` with the address and the listening port of the syslog collector.
