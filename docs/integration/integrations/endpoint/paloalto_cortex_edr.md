## Create API Key

Before using the **Cortex XDR** connector, you must generate an API key in Cortex XDR. For that you need to follow steps bellow :

1. Within **Cortex XDR**, click **Settings**.
2. Click **Configurations**.

    ![Configuration Page](/assets/operation_center/integration_catalog/cloud_and_saas/paloalto_cortex_edr/configuration.png){: style="max-width:100%; height: 500px;"}

3. In the **Configurations** menu, select **API Keys**, which appears in the **Integrations** section.
4. In the API Keys window, click **+New Key** button to create a new API key. And the **Generate API Key** window will open.

    ![Api Key Page](/assets/operation_center/integration_catalog/cloud_and_saas/paloalto_cortex_edr/api_key.png){: style="max-width:100%"}

5. Select the **Standard** Security Level.
6. Select a role for the API key. After selecting the role, click **Generate**.

    ![Generation Button](/assets/operation_center/integration_catalog/cloud_and_saas/paloalto_cortex_edr/generate.png){: style="max-width:100%"}

7. After youâ€™ve generated the key, copy the **API key** value presented and keep it secure.
8. Return to the **API Keys** window, and select the API key you just generated. Also make note of the **API key ID**, which appears in the API Keys table.

    !!! info
        - You will need also the `Fqdn` which is a unique host and domain name associated with each tenant. When you generate the API Key and Key ID, you are assigned an individual `Fqdn`.
