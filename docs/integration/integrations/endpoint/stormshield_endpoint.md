## Configure

This section will guide you to forward Stormshield SES logs to SEKOIA.IO

### Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format Stormshield Endpoint Security.

### Configure the Agent handler

1. Log on out Stormshield SES console
2. Go to `Backoffice > Agent handlers`
3. Select an Agent handler group or create a new one
4. On the Agent handler group, in the `Syslog servers`, click `+ Add a server`

5. In the syslog server configuration:
   
   1. Set the address of the syslog destination to `intake.sekoia.io`
   2. Select `TCP/TLS` as the protocol
   3. Define the syslog destination port to 10514
   4. Select `Raw Json` as message Content
   5. Select `Non-Transparent-Framing` as transfert-type
   6. In the `Structured data` input, add `[SEKOIA@53288 intake_key="<YOUR_INTAKE_KEY>"]` with our intake key as replacement of the placeholder
   7. Save the configuration

## Troubleshooting

### The SES Agent handler cannot authenticate the Sekoia.io syslog endpoint

The Sekoia.io syslog endpoint is secured with a [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certificate.

According to our SES Agent handler installation, it may be necessary to install `ISRG ROOT X1` certificate in our **trusted root certification authorities certificate store**:

On the SES Agent handler machines: 

1. Download the `ISRG ROOT X1` certificate: <https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem>
2. Rename the downloaded certificate by suffixing it with the extension`.crt`
3. Import the certificate in the trusted root certification authorities certificate store of the machine
