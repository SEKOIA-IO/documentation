## Configure

As of now, the main solution to collect ISC DHCP logs leverages the Rsyslog recipe. Please share your experiences with other recipes by editing this documentation.

### Rsyslog

Please refer to the documentation of ISC DHPD to forward events to your rsyslog server. The reader can consult the [Rsyslog Transport](../../../ingestion_methods/syslog/overview/) documentation to forward these logs to Sekoia.io.
