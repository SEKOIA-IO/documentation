# Squid

Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. The analysis of Squid logs by Sekoia.io can detect web threats along as in-progress intrusion and exfiltration attempts.

## Configure

As of now, the main solution to collect Squid logs leverages the Rsyslog recipe. Please share your experiences with other recipes by editing this documentation.

### Rsyslog

In this Section, we detail how to configure Squidâ€™s logging output for Sekoia.io by means of the Rsyslog transport. We hereby focus on the configuration of Squid and invite the reader to the [Rsyslog Transport](../../../ingestion_methods/syslog/overview/) documentation to forward these logs to Sekoia.io.

To configure Squid logging, you can create a new configuration `99-sekoiaio.conf` file in the `/etc/squid/conf.d/` directory of your server. With most of Squid configurations (including Debian, Red Hat Entreprise Linux, etc.), this file will automatically be used.

This file should contain two information:

- The log format used for Sekoia.io.
- The Syslog facility and priority we would like to use.

Content of `/etc/squid/conf.d/99-sekoiaio.conf` file:

```
logformat sekoiaio %ts.%03tu %6tr %>a %Ss/%03>Hs %<st %rm %ru %[un %Sh/%<a %mt "%{Referer}>h" "%{User-Agent}>h"
access_log syslog:local5.info sekoiaio
```
