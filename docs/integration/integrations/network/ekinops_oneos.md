## Configure

This setup guide will show you how to forward your Ekinops OneOS logs to Sekoia.io by means of a syslog transport channel.

### Prerequisites

- Have an internal log concentrator

### Enable Syslog forwarding logs

To enable syslog forwarding logs, you must follow the steps below:

1. Connect on the Ekinops OneOS console
2. Add the log concentrator as a new syslog server
```bash
localhost#configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
localhost(config)#syslog server  <log concentrator server ip> 23 tcp <log concentrator port>
localhost(config)#logging syslog filter all
localhost(config)#logging syslog informational
localhost(config)#end
localhost#write mem
```
3. Check the configuration
```bash
localhost#show syslog servers
S.No Syslog Server                                    Facility VrfName                       Protocol  port    Interface                  Bytes-Sent
1    <log concentrator server ip>                      23      default 
```
4. exit the console

### Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format Ekinops OneOS.

### Forward logs to Sekoia.io

Please consult the [Syslog Forwarding](../../../ingestion_methods/sekoiaio_forwarder/) documentation to forward these logs to Sekoia.io.
