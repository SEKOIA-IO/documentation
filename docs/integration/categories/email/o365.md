Office 365 is a line of subscription services offered by Microsoft as part of the Microsoft Office product line.



## Microsoft Office365 logs

Sekoia.io can pull four categories of logs from Microsoft Office 365 Management API:

- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)  audit events (`Audit.AzureActiveDirectory`)
- Microsoft Exchange audit events (`Audit.Exchange`)
- Microsoft SharePoint audit events (`Audit.SharePoint`)
- General audit events not included in the other log categories (`Audit.General`)

The [Office 365 Management Activity API Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema) documents the schema leveraged by Sekoia.io to monitor activities within your organization.

The Audit logging is turned on by default for Microsoft 365 and Office 365 entreprise organizations. However, when setting up an organization, you should verify the auditing status.

Microsoft provides instructions to verify and configure the auditing status for your organization in the article [Turn auditing on or off](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off).

!!! Important
    Once the integration is created on Sekoia.io, it may take up to 12 hours for the Microsoft API to make data available for the first time.
    After validation from the Microsoft API, it will take **at least** 15 minutes to retrieve the first events.
    Refer to [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-enable-disable#turn-on-auditing) for instructions on how to enable or verify the activation status of audit logs in Office 365.

#### Alternative mode

If you are unable or you don't want to collect Office 365 logs through the management API,
Sekoia.io also supports Office 365 log collection through Azure EventHub. Follow [this guide](/integration/categories/endpoint/azure_windows) for more details on this solution.


### Collect Microsoft Defender for Office365 events

If your organization use Microsoft Defender for Office 365, you can forward malware and threat intelligence events to Sekoia.io.
Refer to [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/siem-integration-with-office-365-ti) to turn on Defender events in the audit logs. These events will be automatically forward with the Office365 integration.


### Enjoy your events
