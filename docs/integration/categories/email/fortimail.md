## Step-by-Step Configuration Procedure

### Instructions on the 3rd Party Solution

This setup guide will show you how to forward your FortiMail logs to Sekoia.io by means of a syslog transport channel.

#### FortiMail Logs

- On FortiMail appliances, most of the important hardware and software activities that are relevant for security detection and analysis are logged into six files:
    - History (statistics): Records all email traffic going through the FortiMail unit.
    - System Event (kevent): Records system management activities, including changes to the system configuration as well as administrator and user log-ins and log-outs.
    - Mail Event (event): Records mail activities.
    - Antispam (spam): Records spam detection events.
    - Antivirus (virus): Records virus intrusion events.
    - Encryption (encrypt): Records detection of IBE-related events.

#### Transport to the Collector

- **Prerequisites:**
    - Administrator privileges on the FortiMail appliance
    - Traffic towards the syslog must be open on `UDP 514`

- **Configure Logging to a Syslog Server:**

    1. Go to `Log and Report > Log Settings > Remote`.
    2. Click `New` to create a new entry OR double-click an existing entry to modify it.
    3. Select `Enable` to allow logging to a remote host.
    4. In `Profile name`, enter a profile name.
    5. In `IP`, enter the IP address of the `Syslog server` where the FortiMail unit will store the logs.
    6. In `Port`, enter the UDP port number on which the Syslog server listens for connections (by default, `UDP 514`).
    7. From `Level`, select the severity level that a log message must equal or exceed in order to be recorded to this storage location.
    8. From `Facility`, select the facility identifier that the FortiMail unit will use to identify itself when sending log messages.

        > To easily identify log messages from the FortiMail unit when they are stored on a remote logging server, enter a unique facility identifier, and verify that no other network devices use the same facility identifier.

    9. From `Log protocol`, select `Syslog`.
    10. In `Logging Policy Configuration`, enable the types of logs you want to record to this storage location.
    11. Click `Create`.
