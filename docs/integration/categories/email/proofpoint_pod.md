## Configure

### Proofpoint On Demand

As a prerequisite, you need to create an APIKey and to get your cluster id:

Copy your cluster id. It is diplayed on the upper-right corner of your management interface, next to the release number.

To create an APIKey, from our dashboard:

- Open the menu, unfold the `Settings` section and go to `API Key Management`.
- Click on the button `Create New` to display the `Create New API Key` dialog box.
- Type a name and generate the API Key.
- Select `View Details` from the ellipsis menu on the fresh API Key and copy the key.


### Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format `Proofpoint PoD`.

### Pull events

Go to the [playbook page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/playbooks) and create a new playbook with the [ProofPoint PoD connector](/integration/action_library/proofpoint.md#get-proofpoint-pod-events).

Set up the trigger configuration with the api key, the cluster id and the intake key. Customize others parameters if needed.

Start the playbook and enjoy your events.
