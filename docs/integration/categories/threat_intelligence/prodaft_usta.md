## Overview

USTA is a market-leading threat intelligence solution provided by PRODAFT specifically designed to combat ransomware, online fraud, and account takeover attempts.

- **Vendor**: PRODAFT  
- **Supported product**: USTA - Account Takeover Prevention  
- **Supported data source**: USTA Compromised credentials feed  
- **Supported environment**: Cloud / SaaS  
- **Detection based on**: External credential compromise intelligence  

This integration enables the ingestion of compromised credential feeds generated by the USTA Account Takeover module into Sekoia.io.  

The feed provides indicators related to exposed or compromised user accounts, allowing SOC teams to correlate external credential compromise signals with authentication activity, detect account takeover attempts, and prioritize remediation actions.

### Example use cases

- Detection of internal authentication attempts involving externally compromised accounts.
- Prioritization of account remediation based on risk details provided.
