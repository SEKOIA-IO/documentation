## Configure

This section will guide you to forward Stormshield SNS logs to Sekoia.

### Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format Stormshield Network Security.

### Import the intake certificate

On a device, please download the [Sekoia.io intake certificate](https://app.sekoia.io/assets/files/SEKOIA-IO-intake.pem)

1. Log on the UTM administration console
2. Click `Configuration` tab
3. On the left panel, Click `Notification` > `Traces - syslog - IPFX`
4. Click `syslog` tab
5. Click `SEKOIA syslog` profile
6. Type `intake.sekoia.io` as the syslog server
7. Select `TLS` as the protocol
8. Select `sekoia_syslog_tls` (10514) as the destination port
9. Select `ISRG Root X` as the Certificate authority
10. Select `RFC5424` as the format
11. In the advanced configuration section, paste the intake key
12. Click `APPLY`

### Configure the log forwarding

You have to go on your Sekoia.io instance to generate an "intake key".
Everything you need to do for this part of the configuration is described [here](../../../collect/intakes.md).

Finally, to push logs, you have to [configure](../../../collect/ingestion_methods/index.md) some filters and rewrite rules in Syslog that will add the proper “intake key” considering your logs.
