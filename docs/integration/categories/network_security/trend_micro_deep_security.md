## Configure

In this guide, you will configure your Security Manager to forward events through syslog.

### Prerequisites

An internal syslog concentrator is required to collect and forward events to Sekoia.io.

### Enable Syslog forwarding

To enable syslog forwarding for Trend Micro Deep Security, please follow [this guide](https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/20_0/on-premise/event-syslog.html).
For Trend Micro Workload Security, please refer to [this documentation](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/docs/workload-security/event-syslog/)

To enable Syslog forwarding, follow these steps:

1. Log on your Security console
2. Provide the IP and the listening port (`514`) of the log concentrator and select `CEF` as the event format

#### Direct forwarding

If the concentrator and all your agents are on the same network or could communicate safely (VPN, ...):

1. Select the transport protocol `UDP` and ask your agents to send events `Directly to the syslog server`
2. Apply the changes

#### Indirect forwarding

If your agents should forward events over untrusted network:

1. Select the transport protocol `TLS` and ask your agents to send events `Via the Workload Security Manager`
2. Generate and add a certificate to the log concentrator
3. Apply the changes and test the connection

For the first connection:

1. The manager should display the error message "Accept Server Certificate?"
2. Check the certificate and click OK to accept it. Test the connection again; it should succeed

   If not, please see the "Troubleshoot event forwarding" section on the Trend-Micro documentation.


## Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format Trend Micro Deep Security / Workload Security.


## Forward logs to Sekoia.io

Please consult the [Syslog Forwarding](/integration/ingestion_methods/syslog/sekoiaio_forwarder.md) documentation to forward these logs to Sekoia.io.
