### Configure Sophos Firewall
You can configure a syslog server in Sophos Firewall by following the instructions below (Which is appropriate for an XG Firewall, please refer to your documentation in other cases).

- Go to System Services > Log Settings and click Add to configure a syslog server.
- Enter a name for the syslog server.
- Enter the IP Address of the syslog server. Messages from the device will be sent to the entered IP address.
- Enter a Port number that the device will use for communicating with the syslog server. Device will send messages using the selected port.
- Select the Facility from the available options, "DEAMON" should work.

!!! Note
    Facility informs the syslog server of the log message's source. It is defined by the syslog protocol. You can configure the facility to distinguish log messages from different devices. This parameter helps you identify the device that recorded a specific log file.

- Confirm the procotol is UDP.
