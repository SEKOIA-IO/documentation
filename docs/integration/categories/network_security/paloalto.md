### Instructions on the 3rd Party Solution

#### Option A - Forward events through a Syslog Forwarder

##### Configure a Syslog server profile

1. In the GUI, go to `Device > Serve Profiles > Syslog`.
2. Click `Add` and enter a name for the profile such as `Syslog server`.
3. If the firewall has more than one virtual system (vsys), select the `Location` (vsys or `Shared`) where this profile is available.
4. Click `Add` and enter the information that the firewall requires to connect to it:

	- Name — Unique name for the server profile.
	- Syslog Server — IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the syslog server.
	- Transport — Select TCP.
	- Port — Select the default is TCP on port 514.
	- Format — Select the syslog message format to use: IETF
	- Facility — Select a syslog standard value (default is LOG_USER) to calculate the priority (PRI) field.

5. Click `OK` to save the server profile.

##### Configure syslog forwarding for Traffic logs

1. Select `Objects > Log Forwarding`, click `Add`, and enter a `Name` to identify the profile.
2. For each log type (here Traffic, Threat and WileFire Malicious) and each severity level, select the `Syslog server` profile and click `OK`.
3. Select `Policies > Security` and select a policy rule.
4. Select the `Actions` tab and select the `Log Forwarding` profile you created.
5. In the `Profile Type` drop-down, select `Profiles` or `Groups`, and then select the security profiles or `Group Profiles` required to trigger log generation and forwarding.
6. Select `Log At Session End` check boxes, and click `OK`.

For detailed information about configuring a log forwarding profile and assigning the profile to a policy rule, see [Configure Log Forwarding](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/configure-log-forwarding.html#id1443a62b-8a0b-41db-a08d-5df934bf0ffc)

##### Configure syslog forwarding for System and User-ID logs

1. In the GUI, go to `Device > Log Settings`.
2. Click each Severity level (High and Critical if also fine), select the `Syslog server` profile, and click `OK`.

### Option B - Forward events through Palo Alto Cortex Data Lake

#### Configure Palo Alto NGFW

1. In the GUI, go to `Objects > Log Forwarding`.
2. Click `Add`, and enter a `Name` to identify the profile.
3. For each log type (here Traffic, Threat and WileFire Malicious), check the box `Cortex Data Lake` in the Forward Method and click `OK`.
4. Select `Policies > Security` and select a policy rule.
5. Select the `Actions` tab and select the `Log Forwarding` profile you created.
6. In the `Profile Type` drop-down, select `Profiles` or `Groups`, and then select the security profiles or `Group Profiles` required to trigger log generation and forwarding.
7. Select both of the `Log at Session Start` and `Log At Session End` check boxes, and click `OK`.

#### Configure Palo Alto Cortex Data Lake

1. On the Cortex Data Lake console, got to `Log Forwarding`
2. Create a new HTTPS Profiles
3. Enter a `Name` to identify the profile and set the URL to `https://intake.sekoia.io/jsons?status_code=200`
4. In the Client Authorization section, select `Basic Authorization` as Type, fill `Username` with any string (e.g. `sekoiaio`) and `Password` with your **intake key** (see step "Instruction on Sekoia")
5. Click `Test Connection` then click `Next`
6. Select `Array JSON` as Payload Format
7. In `Filters`, add log sources to forward:

	|  Log Source   |  Log Type      |
	| ------------- | -------------- |
	| Common Logs   | System         |
	| Common Logs   | Configuration  |
	| Firewall Logs | Authentication |
	| Firewall Logs | Decryption     |
	| Firewall Logs | DNS Security   |
	| Firewall Logs | File           |
	| Firewall Logs | GlobalProtect  |
	| Firewall Logs | HIP Match      |
	| Firewall Logs | IPtag          |
	| Firewall Logs | SCTP           |
	| Firewall Logs | Threat         |
	| Firewall Logs | Traffic        |
	| Firewall Logs | Tunnel         |
	| Firewall Logs | URL            |
	| Firewall Logs | UserID         |

8. Click `Save`
