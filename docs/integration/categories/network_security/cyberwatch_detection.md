## Step-by-Step Configuration Procedure

### Instructions on the 3rd Party Solution

#### Forward Cyberwatch Detection Logs to Sekoia.io

This setup guide will show you how to forward your Cyberwatch logs to Sekoia.io by means of a syslog transport channel.

#### Detailed Procedure:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Have an internal log concentrator.

2. **Enable Syslog Forwarding for Cyberwatch:**
   - Once configured, Cyberwatch will send hourly the latest CVEs detected to the remote Syslog server:
     1. Click `Administration`.
     2. Click `External tools`.
     3. Click `Remote Syslog server`.

   - In the Remote Syslog server configuration, provide the address, the port, and the transport to the syslog concentrator.
