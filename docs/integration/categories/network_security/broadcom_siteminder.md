## Step-by-Step Configuration Procedure

1. Log in to your Siteminder applicance as root.
2. Find the smaccess.log file on the system :
```bash
find /opt -name smaccess.log 2>/dev/null
```
3. Edit /etc/syslog-ng.conf
4. add a logging source as follows (replace {file_search_result} by the path you found above):
```bash
source s_siteminder_access {file("{file_search_result}");};
```
5. add a logging destination as follows :
> Note : if your security policy requires extra-security (ex: tls) between the application and the syslog forwarder, modify the configuration accordingly
```bash
destination d_syslog_forwarder {syslog("<YOUR_SYSLOG_FORWARDER_SERVER_IP>" transport("tcp") port(514));};
```
6. add a new "log" row filled with your new source and destination :
```bash
log {source(s_siteminder_accessdestination); destination(d_syslog_forwarder);};
```
7. save the file
8. restart the service
```bash
systemctl restart syslog-ng
```
