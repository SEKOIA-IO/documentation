## Step-by-Step Configuration Procedure

In this documenation we will explain how to collect and send SearchLight logs to Sekoia.io.

### Instructions on the 3rd Party Solution

First of all, you will have to retrieve configuration information.
To do so, connect to the [Digital Shadows portal](https://portal-digitalshadows.com/) to get an API key under the heading `api` > "`tored Objects` > `Portal` > `Searchlight API doc`.

Then, you will need to retrieve the following information from the portal:

- `API URL`
- `Basicauth key`
- `Basicauth secret`
- Your Searchlight `account ID`

You now have all information to configure the Digital Shadows Searchlight module and its `Send events` action to Sekoia.io.
