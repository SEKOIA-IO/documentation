Google Workspace, formerly known as G Suite, is a cloud-based productivity and collaboration platform developed by Google, featuring tools like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Docs. It allows users to create, communicate, and collaborate in real-time from any location, promoting efficient teamwork and secure file management. Complementing this, ChromeOS is a Linux-based operating system designed for Chromebooks, focusing on delivering a fast and secure user experience centered around web applications and cloud services. Together, Google Workspace and ChromeOS provide an integrated environment that enhances productivity and collaboration in the digital age.

## Configure

### Prerequisites

- Google licence Enterprise standard or higher
- Access to Sekoia.io Intakes and Playbook pages with write permissions
- Administrator access to the Google Cloud console and to Google Workspace

### Create a dedicated service account

To create a service account you have to :

  1. Create a project
  2. Turn on the APIs for the service account
    a. In your project, select *APIs & Services* and then *Library*
    b. Select the *Admin SDK API* and click on *Enable* (you can write the name in the search box to find it more easily)
  3. Under *APIs & Services*, set up the *OAuth consent screen*
    - Click on *OAuth consent screen*
    - For *User type*, select *Internal*
    - Write an *App Name*, a *User support email* and an email address for the *Developer contact information*
    - Select the following scopes (see [Choose Reports API scopes](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/auth)):
        -  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly`
        -  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.usage.readonly`
  4. Create the service account
    - Under *IAM & Admins*, click on *Service Accounts* and click on *Create Service Account*
    - Specify the Service Account details
    - Click on *Done* (no need to *Grant this service account access to project* and *Grant users access to this service account*)
  5. Create a delegation
    - Find your new *Service Account* and select *Managed details*
    - Click on *Advanced settings*
    - Under "Domain-wide delegation" find your service account's *Client ID*. Copy the client ID value to your clipboard.
    - Click on *View Google Workspace Admin Console*, then sign in using a **super administrator user account** and continue following these steps.
    - In the Google Admin console, go to *Menu* > *Security* > *Access* and *data control* > *API controls*.
    - Click Manage Domain Wide Delegation.
    - Click *Add new*.
    - In the "Client ID" field, paste the client ID that you previously copied.
    - In the "OAuth Scopes" field, enter a comma-delimited list of the scopes required by your application. This is the same set of scopes you defined when configuring the OAuth consent screen.
        -  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly`
        -  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.usage.readonly`
    - Click *Authorize*


For more details in each steps please read this [Documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?hl=en) and [this one about delegation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#optional_set_up_domain-wide_delegation_for_a_service_account)

### Create and download JSON keys (service account credentials)

To use a service account from outside of Google Cloud, such as on Sekoia.io, you must first establish the identity of the service account. Public/private key pairs provide a secure way of accomplishing this goal. When you create a service account key, the public portion is stored on Google Cloud, while the private portion is available only to you.

!!! Note
	By default, service account keys never expire.

1. Go to the Service accounts page
2. Select your cloud project
3. Click the email address of the service account that you want to create a key for
4. Click the **Keys** tab
5. Click the **Add key** drop-down menu, then select **Create new key**
6. Select **JSON** as the Key type and click **Create**

!!! Important
    Clicking **Create** downloads a service account key file. After you download the key file, you cannot download it again. You will need it on the following steps on Sekoia.io.

Find more information on the [official google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete).

**Example of JSON key file**

```JSON
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "PROJECT_ID",
  "private_key_id": "KEY_ID",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nPRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
  "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
}
```

## Sekoia.io configuration procedure

### Create your intake

1. Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the `Google Report`.
2. Edit the intake configuration with the following attribut:
    * Select the `application name` what you to fetch events from
    * Type the `an Google workspace admin email`.
  
!!! Important
    * This Google workspace admin email is any user part of the domain **that has** the right to view de Data of Google Workspace
    * If you are uncertain whether to use a super admin or admin email, make sure you have the appropriate permissions in the email for the service you are requesting. For example, if you need to access logs on Google Vault, you will need the Access all logs permission.

!!! Important
    Google Workspace events may be available in the Admin console and the Google Report API with delay.
    This delay can be from a couple of minutes up to several hours (see [documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566?hl=en)).
    Please adjust the timedelta parameter in the configuration accordingly.
