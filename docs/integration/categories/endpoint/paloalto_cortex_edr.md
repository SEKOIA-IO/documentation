7. After youâ€™ve generated the key, copy the **API key** value presented and keep it secure.
8. Return to the **API Keys** window, and select the API key you just generated. Also make note of the **API key ID**, which appears in the API Keys table.

    !!! info
        - You will need also the `Fqdn` which is a unique host and domain name associated with each tenant. When you generate the API Key and Key ID, you are assigned an individual `Fqdn`.


## Configure

### Create the intake

1. Go to the [Intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new `Palo Alto Cortex XDR (EDR)` intake.
2. Create or Select a Palo Alto account with an `API Key`, `API Key ID` and `Fqdn`.
3. Edit the intake configuration with a `chunk size` - Default is `100` and a `frequency` - Default is `60`
