## Configure

### Prerequisite

For on-premise environment, network access must be open to forward logs from the EDR Console to Sekoia.io on the expected port.

### Steps

#### In Sekoia.io

Create a new Nucleon EDR intake on Sekoia.io.
Extract the intake key. This key will be configured in the EDR Console.

#### In Nucleon EDR Console

1. Open the Entities view to access the list of all entities your user can manage.

    - Host: `intake.sekoia.io`
    - Port: `10514`
    - Protocol: `TLS`
    - Format: `RFC 5424`
    - Click on `Add Block` to add structured data to the syslog exporter
    - Block ID: `sekoia@53288`
    - Click on `Add Parameter` to add a new parameter in the structured block
    - Key: `intake_key`
    - Value: *Insert the generated intake key here*
