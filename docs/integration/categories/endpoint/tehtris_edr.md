## Configure

### Prerequisites

To forward events produced by TEHTRIS EDR to Sekoia.io, you have to:

1. Contact your TEHTRIS referent to activate the XDR Platform APIs for your tenant and ask to add the [Sekoia.io IP address](https://api.sekoia.io/outgoing-ips) to the allowlist

2. Log on the TEHTRIS XDR platform and navigate to `SOAR > Key Management`

3. Click on the button `Add`, enter the label of the API Key and select, at least, the API `Fetch Events`. You are required to create a filter (this filter may be left empty if desired).

4. At the end, click on `Create` to generate the API Key

### Create the intake

1. To create the intake, go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format `TEHTRIS Endpoint Detection & Reponse`.
2. Set up the intake configuration with your API key and your tenant ID (most of time, your tenant ID is the subdomain of your TEHTRIS instance; eg: `https://{tenant_id}.tehtris.net`)
