### Instructions on the 3rd Party Solution

This setup guide will show you how to forward both your access and error logs to Sekoia.io by means of a syslog transport channel.

#### Forward Audit Logs

- Follow this [guide](https://docs.netscaler.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/system/audit-logging/configuring-audit-logging.html) to enable syslog forwarding for audit logs.

!!! Important
    Make sure `-dateFormat MMDDYYYY` is set and the date is present in logs.

#### Forward Application Firewall Logs

- To enable application firewall logs forwarding, see this [guide](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX138973/how-to-send-application-firewall-messages-to-a-separate-syslog-server) and apply the following command to convert Application Firewall logs into CEF events:
