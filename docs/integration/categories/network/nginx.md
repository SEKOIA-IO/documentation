## Step-by-Step Configuration Procedure

This setup guide will show you how to forward your NGINX logs to Sekoia.io by means of a syslog transport channel.

### Instructions on the 3rd Party Solution

#### Forward NGINX Logs to a syslog forwarder

To configure NGINX to forward logs to an IP with syslog and the UDP protocol, please add these lines in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

```
access_log syslog:server=REMOTE_SERVER_IP:LISTENING_PORT_UDP,tag=nginx;
error_log syslog:server=REMOTE_SERVER_IP:LISTENING_PORT_UDP,tag=nginx;
```

!!! Note
    Please replace `REMOTE_SERVER_IP` by you syslog forwarder IP and `LISTENING_PORT_UDP` by the relevant value.
