## Step-by-Step Configuration Procedure

### Instructions on the 3rd Party Solution

This setup guide will show you how to forward your ArubaOS logs to Sekoia.io by means of a syslog transport channel.

#### Enable Syslog Forwarding for ArubaOS

- Log in to your ArubaOS device using SSH, Telnet, or the web-based management interface, depending on your preferred method.
- Access the configuration mode on your ArubaOS device. For example, if you are using the CLI, you might use the `configure terminal` command.

#### Configure Syslog Settings

- Use the following command to specify the syslog server's IP address:
  ```bash
  logging x.x.x.x
  ```
  Replace `x.x.x.x` with the IP address of your syslog concentrator.
- Additionally, you can specify the syslog server's UDP port using the `port` keyword:
  ```bash
  logging x.x.x.x port yyyy
  ```
  Replace `yyyy` with the port number your syslog concentrator is configured to listen on.

#### Set Log Severity Levels

- Configure the severity level of logs that will be sent to the syslog server.
  ```bash
  logging level informational
  ```

#### Save Configuration Changes

- Save your configuration changes by issuing the appropriate command (e.g., `write memory` or `copy running-config startup-config`) to ensure that the syslog configuration persists across reboots.

#### Test Syslog Forwarding (Optional)

- You can generate a test log entry to ensure that logs are being forwarded to the syslog server.
  For example, use the following command:
  ```bash
  logging x.x.x.x testing
  ```
  This will generate a test log message that should appear in your syslog server's logs.

#### Verify Syslog Server Configuration

- On your syslog server, verify that it is configured to accept syslog messages in UDP from the ArubaOS device on the specified port.
