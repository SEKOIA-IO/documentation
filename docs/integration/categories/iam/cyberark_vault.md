    > Note : if your security policy requires extra-security (ex: tls) between the application and the syslog forwarder, modify the configuration accordingly

    ```bash
    SyslogServerIP={IP_OF_YOUR_SEKOIA_FORWARDER}
    SyslogServerPort={SEKOIA_FORWARDER_SPECIFIC_PORT}
    SyslogServerProtocol=TCP
    SyslogTranslatorFile=Syslog\QRadar.sample.xsl
    UseLegacySyslogFormat=no
    ```

3. After saving DBPARM.ini file, restart the vault server 
4. Ensure that the Vault starts successfully and that there are no errors in the log.
