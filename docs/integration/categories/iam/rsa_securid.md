1. On the upper bar, go to `Setup` and select `System Settings`.
2. Under `Basic Settings`, click on `Logging`.
3. Select `Primary` as the selected instance and click `Next`
4. In the section `Log levels`, choose the level for each type.

6. Click `Save`


## Create the intake

Go to the [intake page](https://app.sekoia.io/operations/intakes) and create a new intake from the format `RSA SecurID`.

## Forward logs to Sekoia.io
