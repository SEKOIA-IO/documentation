# Intake Categories Overview

Welcome to the Intake Categories section of our documentation! This section provides an organized view of different intake categories used for log collection and processing purposes. Here, you'll find comprehensive guides and detailed information about various types of data sources, how to configure them, and best practices for ensuring seamless data ingestion.

## Structure of the Intake Categories Section

The Intake Categories section is organized into several sub-categories as explained in the [Best Practices for Using Sekoia SOC Platform page](/getting_started/best_practices.md), each representing a different type of data source. Below is the structure of the folder:

- **Applicative**: This category includes documentation on various application-level technologies  like Apache HTTP Server, Salesforce, JumpCloud.
- **Email**: Documentation related to email data sources can be found here.
- **Endpoint**: This category covers endpoint security solutions like EDR and host/system logs for Workstations and/or Servers.
- **Generic**: General and versatile data sources are documented in this category, like CEF format.
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management (IAM) related technologies like MicroSoft EntraID, Okta, Wallix Bastion, OpenLDAP...
- **Network**: Documentation for network technologies like Squid, F5 BIG-IP, HAProxy or data sources such as Flow logs, HTTP requests, DHCP, DNS...
- **Network Security**: This category includes network security-specific data sources like WAF, Firewall, IDS, IPS, NDR...

Each category contains detailed pages for individual integrations.

## Standardized Page Structure for Integrations

!!! Note
    The standardisation is still in Work In Progress. Feel free to contribute to the effort by communicating inconstancies to the Support with your detailed written suggestions or the pull request link.

To ensure consistency and ease of use, each detailed page of an integration follows a standardized structure. This includes:

1. **Overview**: This section provides a high-level confirmation of what the technology does and whether it meets the customer's needs.
2. **High-Level Architecture Diagram**: When possible, a diagram is included to illustrate the architecture of the integration.
3. **Specifications**: Contains prerequisites, supported transport protocols/methods, and other technical details.
4. **Logs Details**: Information about the logs collected from the integration, including a sample of supported raw events.
5. **Step-by-Step Configuration Procedure**: Detailed instructions on how to set up and configure the integration.
6. **Detection**: Information on detection capabilities related to the integration with a list of built-in rules, and the list of extracted fields that can be used for creating your own custom rules or hunting activites.
7. **Further Readings**: Additional resources and links for further information.
