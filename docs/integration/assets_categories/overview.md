# Asset Categories Overview

Welcome to the Asset Categories section of our documentation! This section is designed to help you find and utilize various asset connectors that bring your IT infrastructure visibility directly into the Sekoia.io SOC Platform. Whether you're looking to manage devices, users, or vulnerabilities, you'll find the resources and guidance you need here, categorized by the type of asset they represent.

## Structure of the Asset Categories Section

The Asset Categories section is organized into several sub-categories, each representing a different type of asset. Below is the structure of the folder:

- **Device**: Asset connectors for endpoint devices, workstations, and compute instances across different platforms. This includes:

- **User**: Asset connectors for identity and access management systems. This includes:

Each category contains detailed pages for individual asset connectors, including configuration steps, required permissions, and integration guides.

## What are Asset Connectors?

Asset connectors automatically synchronize your IT assets from various sources into Sekoia.io, providing a unified view of your infrastructure. This enables:

- **Centralized Asset Inventory**: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all devices, users, and vulnerabilities across your environment
- **Enhanced Context**: Enrich security events with asset information for better investigation and response
- **Risk Management**: Understand your exposure by correlating vulnerabilities with active threats
- **Compliance**: Track asset configurations and user access for compliance reporting
