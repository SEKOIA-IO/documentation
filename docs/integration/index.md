# Integrations

Welcome to the Integrations section of our documentation! This section is designed to help you navigate and utilize our various integration methods, intake categories, and automation tools. Whether you're looking to ingest data, develop custom integrations, or automate your processes, you'll find the resources and guidance you need here.

## Structure of the Integrations Section

### Ingestion Methods

In this section, you'll find detailed information on the various methods (pushing on [HTTPS](/integration/ingestion_methods/https/overview.md) or [Syslog](/integration/ingestion_methods/syslog/overview.md), or pulling a [remote external cloud storage](/integration/ingestion_methods/cloud_saas/overview.md)) you can use to ingest data into Sekoia.io SOC Platform. We provide [comprehensive guides and examples](/integration/ingestion_methods/index.md) to help you set up and manage your data ingestion processes efficiently.

### Intake Categories

This section offers an organized view of different [intake categories](/integration/categories/overview.md), that are used for log collection and processing purposes. You'll find documentation on various types of data (endpoint, network, email...) and how to configure each one, ensuring you a smooth BUILD phase of Third party logs collection.

### Automation Categories

This section contains a wealth of [automation actions](/integration/action_library/overview.md) to interract with Third party directly from and without leaving the Sekoia.io SOC Platform. These resources are designed to help you streamline your workflows and automate repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on more strategic activities.

### How to Develop A New Integration

For those looking to extend the capabilities of Sekoia.io SOC Platform, this section provides a [step-by-step guide on how to develop custom integrations](/integration/develop_integration/overview.md). You'll learn about our integration framework, best practices, and how to contribute to our ecosystem.

### FAQ Section

To assist users in quickly finding answers to common questions and issues, we have introduced an FAQ section within our Integrations documentation. This section is categorized to cover a wide range of topics, from general questions and setup guides to troubleshooting tips and best practices. Whether you're new to integrations or seeking advanced configuration guidance, our FAQ section is designed to provide comprehensive support.
