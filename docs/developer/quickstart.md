# Quickstart

Welcome to Sekoia.io's public REST API. Note that Sekoia.io GUI is built upon this API.

### When to use the Sekoia.io API?

* **Data sharing**: Access Sekoia.io data in your application.
* **Integration**: Enable third-party applications to execute actions within Sekoia.io.
* **Automation**: Automate actions and tasks via your own scripts.

Here are some characteristics of our REST API:

* **Client/Server architecture**: Operates through HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE...)
* **Stateless design**: No persistent connection maintained between consecutive requests.
* **Action identification**: Each specific action correlates with a unique URL endpoint.

## Authentication

Access the complete Sekoia.io API through `https://api.sekoia.io`.

To authenticate, use a Bearer Token in all requests by including the header `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`.

**Example using curl**:
```bash
curl -XGET -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.sekoia.io/v1/sic/conf/rules-catalog/rules
```
Create your unique API key following the guidelines provided [here](/getting_started/manage_api_keys.md).
The permissions required for your key depend on what you want to achieve. For accessing information from Sekoia.io, read-only permissions are adequate; however, executing operations on Sekoia.io necessitates additional write permissions.

Our documentation provides information on each endpoint and specifies the required permissions.

### Regions
Sekoia operates in various European and Middle-Eastern regions. Each region is designed to meet specific legal and safety requirements.
Sekoia API's base URL depends on the hosting region of your subscription (FRA1, USA1, UAE1, ...). For instance, if you access the Sekoia application via `https://app.mco1.sekoia.io/`, you shall use our API via `https://app.mco1.sekoia.io/api`.

## Organization

Our API documentation is categorized based on the diverse features provided by the platform.

#### Structure
Each action is described and contains the following information:

* Action name
* Required permissions
* Mandatory and optional data parameters
* Endpoint URL
* Query and response examples

The method of passing data through the API varies based on the endpoint. Data may be transmitted as `query parameters` or within an `application/json` body. Query parameters means that data is encoded within the URL.

### Some use-cases

#### URL parameters
URL parameters provide a direct method to convey data within the URL. Positioned after the question mark (?) and separated by an ampersand (&), these parameters are essential for transmitting information effectively.
For instance, in the following request, "match[name]=Suspicious%20Windows%20Defender%20Exclusion%20Command" and "limit=10" are the URL parameters.

```bash
curl -XGET -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.sekoia.io/v1/sic/conf/rules-catalog/rules?match[name]=Suspicious%20Windows%20Defender%20Exclusion%20Command&limit=10
```

URL parameters are typically used in simple requests, particularly search queries, where concise and uncomplicated data needs to be conveyed, commonly associated with `GET` requests.

#### Request Body with JSON Payload
Use the request body to transmit data in JSON format, known for its readability and compatibility for both humans and machines. Ensure to include the "Content-Type" header in your request, with the request body formatted as a JSON object.

This approach is ideal for more complex requests, such as creating or updating resources on the server, often executed with POST or PUT requests. The example below demonstrates the "Invite a user" action involving a POST request with an application/json body:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.sekoia.io/v1/invitations \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
   -d '{"email": "john.doe@example.com","communities": {"88dcb0c6-4efe-4256-95f1-40d2c4fefefd": ["44aaa41f-24ee-41d3-a7c1-4677da8b9243"]}}'

   # ["44aaa41f-24ee-41d3-a7c1-4677da8b9243"] corresponds to the UUID of the role assigned to the user.
   # This information is retrieved with the action "List the roles of a community"
```

!!! Note
    In requests involving the creation or edition of server resources, it may be necessary to include parameters in the URL to specify the targeted object. The Sekoia.io API often requires passing the UUID of the specific object intended for modification through the URL.

#### Filtering

Many API methods accept filtering and matching parameters. A client can request specific content from the Sekoia.io API by specifying a set of filters.

##### Match

The `match[<field>]` field parameter can be used to filter documents given the value of a specific `field`. A filter parameter can be specified any number of times, where all filter fields are ANDed together.

It should be noted that each `field` must not occur more than once. Multiple values of a match parameter are separated by a comma (U+002C COMMA, “,”) without any spaces. If multiple values are present, the match is treated as a logical OR.

**Examples of match parameters**

```
# list alerts triggered on entity entity1 or entity2
/alerts?match[entity_name]=entity1,entity2

# list alerts triggered on entity1 with rule named rule1 or rule2
/alerts?match[entity_name]=entity1&match[rule_name]=rule1,rule2
```

#### Date ranges

The `date[field]` parameter can be used to filter documents given a date range on a specific `field`. The value of the parameter must be two dates separated by a comma (U+002C COMMA, “,”) without any spaces. The first date is the start date and the second date is the end date.

Example of date range parameter: `date[created_at]=2025-09-22T01:20:00.000Z,2025-09-22T23:59:59.999Z`.


## Code examples
Please find below two python code examples, one with a `GET` request with `query parameters` and another with a `POST` request and an `application/json` body.

### Retrieving information with Query Parameters

Let's delve into an example where we retrieve details about the rule titled "Suspicious Windows Defender Exclusion Command." To find this information, we can leverage the [List Rules](https://docs.sekoia.io/develop/rest_api/operation_center/configuration/#tag/rules-catalog/operation/get_rules_resource) endpoint.

The documentation means that no parameters are mandatory for this request to execute successfully. However, to fulfill our specific requirement, we opt to use the `match[name]` parameter, designed to "Match rules by their name (separated by commas)."

The following script has been crafted to fetch this information and display the results on the standard output (STDOUT).


```python
import json
import logging

import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
BASE_URL = "https://api.sekoia.io/v1"

def get_request():

    url = f"{BASE_URL}/sic/conf/rules-catalog/rules?match[name]=Suspicious Windows Defender Exclusion Command"
    res = requests.get(url, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"})

    # In case of a success, the status code 200 is returned by the API
    if res.status_code == 200:
        data = res.json()

        # We print the result using the library JSON to get a pretty display
        logging.info(f"This is the result of the request:")
        logging.info(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
    # In case of authentication failed
    elif res.status_code == 401:
        logging.error(f"Cannot invite the user. Authentication failed: {res.status_code}")
        logging.error(res.text)
    # In case of insufficient permissions
    elif res.status_code == 403:
        logging.error(f"Insufficient permissions: {res.status_code}")
        logging.error(res.text)
    # In case of another status code
    else:
        logging.error(f"Error during the API request.")
        logging.error(res.text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    get_request()
```

### Create a SIGMA Rule with a POST Request and JSON Body

In this example, we will create a simple SIGMA rule nammed "My custom SIGMA rule", so it will be a `POST` request. According to [this documentation](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/develop/rest_api/configuration/#tag/rules-catalog/operation/post_rules_resource) in order to create a new rule we must provide the request with a minimum of mandatory fields. You will find in the following table what we will use in the Python script:


In this scenario, we aim to create a SIGMA rule named "My custom SIGMA rule" through a **POST request**. Referring to the relevant documentation, some mandatory fields must be provided to successfully create a new rule. Below, you will find a summary of the key fields used in the Python script:

| Fields | Value for the example |
| --- | --- |
| name | "My custom SIGMA rule" |
| type | "sigma" |
| description | "Detect spawn of Powershell" |
| payload | "detection:\\n  selection:\\n    process.command\_line\|contains: 'powershell'\\n  condition: selection" |
| severity | 40 |
| effort | 3 |
| alert\_type\_uuid | "599f4b1a-dd60-43fe-8ee9-07d3c5d00ded" |
| enabled | True |

```python
import logging
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
BASE_URL = "https://api.sekoia.io/v1"

def post_request():

    url = f"{BASE_URL}/sic/conf/rules-catalog/rules"
    body = {
      "name": "My custom SIGMA rule",
      "type": "sigma",
      "description": "Detect spawn of Powershell",
      "payload": "detection:\n  selection:\n    process.command_line|contains: 'powershell'\n  condition: selection",
      "severity": 40,
      "effort": 3,
      "alert_type_uuid": "599f4b1a-dd60-43fe-8ee9-07d3c5d00ded",
      "enabled": True
    }

    # The body is passed as a parameter of the post method.
    res = requests.post(url, json=body, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"})

    # In case of a success, the status code 204 is returned by the API
    if res.status_code == 200:
        logging.info(f"The rule has been created on your community")
    # In case of authentication failed
    elif res.status_code == 401:
        logging.error(f"Cannot create the rule. Authentication failed: {res.status_code}")
        logging.error(res.text)
    # In case of another status code
    else:
        logging.error(f"Error during the API request.")
        logging.error(res.text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    post_request()
```

### Advanced Example - Searching Events with Sekoia.io API
It is possible to search in your events by using the Sekoia.io API. Search for events can request some time to be processed and as a reminder, the API is stateless, that means no connection is maintained between two requests.

To address the asynchronous nature of event searches, Sekoia.io introduces the concept of a search job, which offers a structured solution to manage this process effectively.

We outline three essential steps involved in executing a search job:

* [Create an event search job](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/develop/rest_api/configuration/#tag/events/operation/post_event_search_resource) - This step requires to provide the search query and the time window. The endpoint returns a `job UUID` which will be used in the next steps.
* [Get an event search job](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/develop/rest_api/configuration/#tag/events/operation/get_event_search_job_info_resource) - This step is used to get information about the status of a job by providing its UUID. Jobs can have five statuses:
    * `0`: the job is not started
    * `1`: the job is in progress
    * `2`: the job is done (events can be retrieved)
    * `3`: the job is canceled
    * `4`: the job has failed
* [Get the events found by an event search job in descending order](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/develop/rest_api/configuration/#tag/events/operation/get_event_search_job_events_resource) - This steps is used to retrieved the events when the job is done (status `2`). It gives you the events in descending order (latest events first) and by default the limit is set to 100 events (up to 1000). An offset can be specified to get more of them.

#### Python3 script
This Python script uses these 3 actions to perform a search and print the events to STDOUT. Only the latest 100 are printed.

!!! Note
    You need at least Python 3.10 to run this script.

#### How to use the script
Here is how to use the script:
```bash
search_events.py [-h] --dates DATES --query QUERY [-v] APIKEY
```

* `--dates` is used to specify to the time windows. The format used is `earliest_time,latest_time`. Dates can be in ISO8601 or relative format.
* `--query` is the query in Dork format (same langage as the Sekoia.io event page)
* `-v` to get verbose mode
* `APIKEY` is the Sekoia.io key with the `SIC_READ_INTAKES` permission

**Example**:

To get events with source IP `1.2.3.4` in the last 30 days:
```bash
search_events.py [-h] --dates="-30d,now" --query='source.ip: \"1.2.3.4\"' YOUR_API_KEY
```
