It requires you to give a 6-digit verification code generated from your phone in addition to your username and password login. When two-factor authentication is enabled, you will need your password and a verification code from your phone whenever you sign in on SEKOIA.IO platform. How do I enable two-factor authentication?

SEKOIA.IO is able to collect logs through various mechanisms, configuration on your side should be easy! Here is an overview on how integration could be done with SEKOIA.IO. SEKOIA.IO supports the following log collectors: Syslog over TLS ( intake.sekoia.io:10514 ): you can forward your events by using the Syslog protocol specified in RFC 5424. RELP over TLS ( intake.sekoia.io:11514 ): your can forward your events by using Rsyslog\u2019s reliable protocol called RELP. HTTPS ( https://intake.sekoia.io ): you can POST your JSON events. Cloud hosting polling: you can configure SEKOIA.IO to regularly retrieve your logs. If these solutions do not meet your needs, we can also configure a dedicated secured network through a VPN and retrieve your logs directly (please contact us for more information). Syslog integration We are providing documentation and example configurations on how to configure your log system for Rsyslog, but it should be easy to configure other log collectors to forward their events to SEKOIA.IO.

It performs both of the main DNS server roles, acting as an authoritative name server for domains, and acting as a recursive resolver in the network. Setup This setup guide will show you how to forward logs produced by your BIND server to SEKOIA.IO by means of an rsyslog transport channel. On most GNU/Linux servers, two packages need to be installed: rsyslog and rsyslog-gnutls .

In this documenation we will explain 2 ways to collect and send Windows logs to SEKOIA.IO. From the Windows machine directly to SEKOIA.IO using the NXLog agent From the Windows machine to an internal log concentrator (Rsyslog), then forwarded to SEKOIA.IO In addition, this documentation will explain how to collect and send Windows logs from sensitive assets such as Domain Controllers, if you don't want to install a third party agent. Windows Event logs On Microsoft Windows workstations and servers, most of the important hardward and software activities that are relevant for security detection and analysis, are logged into three files. Application: for Windows components such as drivers and built-in interface elements System: records the events related to programs installed on a system Security: records the events related to security, such as logon attempts and ressource access Those logs a readable locally in the Windows Event Viewer, in the section Windows Logs. If you want to improve detection and analysis, you may want to enable Sysmon. Warning: The installation of this tool will generate more logs, so it will consume more CPU ressources. Install it on equipements that are correctly dimensioned, or try it on low risk assets at first. Sysmon is a Microsoft tool you can download on their website . A common installation instruction and configuration file is available on SwiftOnSecurity's Github . You will find dedicated NXLog configuration file for Sysmon usage at the end of this page. This setup guide will show you how to forward events produced by a Windows system either directly to SEKOIA.IO, or through your local rsyslog server. On most linux servers, two packages need to be installed: rsyslog and rsyslog-gnutls. Transport to the concentrator NXLog agent to the Rsyslog NXLog setup on Windows This section describes how to configure NXLog to forward your Windows events by means of a syslog transport channel. First of all, download NXLog at the following link : https://nxlog.co/products/all/download.

Prerequisites The following prerequisites are needed in order to setup efficient Rsyslog: Have administrator privileges of the Debian server: root . Inbound traffic from the equipments to the Rsyslog must be open on TCP 514 . Outbound traffic from the Rsyslog to the SEKOIA.IO platform must be open on TCP 10514 (IP for intake.sekoia.io is 145.239.192.38 ). General procedure After receiving the IDs to connect to the Linux server, the main activities are to be followed. Connect to the Rsyslog node using SSH Install the relevant packages Modify the /etc/rsyslog.conf main configuration file Create configuration files for each technology you want to forward to SEKOIA.IO Edit these files with the related Intake Keys Download the SEKOIA.IO certificate Start the Rsyslog service and ensure it is correclty set-up Example of auto-setup configuration In order to help users setting up this concentrator we suggest the following bash script working for Ubuntu or Debian server.

By using this prococol, SEKOIA.IO\u2019s collection point will acknowledge logs when receiving it. This will let the client Rsyslog be able to resend events if an error occured. SEKOIA.IO\u2019s RELP endpoint is available at relp.intake.sekoia.io ( 145.239.192.124 ) on port 11514 . The most noticeable change using RELP in Rsyslog, is the output module used ( omrelp ). The first step is to install rsyslog-relp and rsyslog-openssl packages to be able to push logs. Most distributions are providing these packages natively. Then, you have to edit your main Rsyslog configuration to load the omrelp module: 1 module ( load = \"omrelp\" tls . tlslib = \"openssl\" ) Finally, you have to configure the output action to push your events to SEKOIA.IO via the RELP protocol. In this example, we are pushing Unbound events. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 template ( name = \"SEKOIAIOUnboundTemplate\" type = \"string\" string = \"<%pri%>1 %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %hostname% %app-name% %procid% LOG [SEKOIA@53288 intake_key= \\\" YOUR_INTAKE_KEY \\\" ] %msg% \\n \" ) if ( $programname startswith ' unbound ' ) then { action ( type = \"omrelp\" target = \"relp.intake.sekoia.io\" port = \"11514\" tls = \"on\" tls . caCert = \"/etc/rsyslog.d/SEKOIA-IO-intake.pem\" tls . authmode = \"name\" tls . permittedPeer = [ \"relp.intake.sekoia.io\" ] template = \"SEKOIAIOUnboundTemplate\" ) } Troubleshooting After setting up your Rsyslog, you may face issues due to contextual environment or error during copy pasting. Rsyslog daemon Ensure the Rsyslog service is currrently running on the server 1 ps -A | grep rsyslog You should see a line with rsyslogd daemon. If not, try to restart the service: 1 sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service Also insure the following lines are not commented in the configuration file /etc/rsyslog.conf : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # provide TCP syslog reception module ( load = \"imtcp\" ) input ( type = \"imtcp\" port = \"514\" ) # provides UDP syslog reception module ( load = \"imudp\" ) input ( type = \"imudp\" port = \"514\" ) Local messages Ensure the logs are received on the Rsyslog server, meaning: - Configurations are correctly undertaken on the remote equipements - Internal network flows are open on TCP or UDP 514 To check it, run the following command: 1 tail -n 15 /var/log/syslog Forwarded messages to SEKOIA.IO Ensure the connection is ESTABLISHED between the Rsyslog server and SEKOIA.IO. To do so, please run the following command: 1 sudo ss -ltp | grep syslog If the connection is not established, and the previous statuses are operational, it is possible that a file xx-<technology>.conf has a mistyping. By experience, most of the time there is a misconfiguration in the IF condition. For example, if you receive the Fortigate logs in /var/log/syslog but not in SEKOIA.IO, you can follow those steps: First try to log the raw events to a local file, by appending the following line in the configuration file: 1 *.* then /tmp/fortigate.log ; SEKOIAIOFortigateTemplate Restart the Rsyslog service 1 sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service Check if the fortigate.log file is created and populated 1 sudo tail /tmp/fortigate.log Then edit your configuration file by adding the if condition step by step","title":"Rsyslog"},{"location":"integrations/transport/rsyslog/#forward-logs-to-sekoiaio-using-rsyslog","text":"","title":"Forward Logs to SEKOIA.IO Using Rsyslog"},{"location":"integrations/transport/rsyslog/#overview","text":"Many technologies or agents allows the forwarding of their logs using the syslog protocol (RFC 5426).

All Intelligence Center endpoints start with https://api.sekoia.io/v2/inthreat/ . Authentication Authentication is required for all API endpoints. Authentication is done with the Authorization header: 1 Authorization : Bearer < APIKEY > Feeds A feed allows filtering the CTI Objects based on some filters. The available filters are: Types TLPs Targeted sectors of activity Targeted locations Sources A feed can be consumed by all the users belonging to the community that created it. Default Feed A default feed with no filters is available in all communities without having to create it. The special feed ID to use is d6092c37-d8d7-45c3-8aff-c4dc26030608 . Feed Creation The easiest way to create feed configurations is to use the Intelligence Center interface, by clicking on Feeds in the left menu. The dropdown next to the feed's name will allow you to copy the ID or the consumption URLs of the feed. If you would prefer creating the feed with the API, you can use the feeds endpoint. The result should contain the feed id that may be used to consume the feed. Feed Consumption To consume the objects from a feed the following endpoint may be used: GET v2/inthreat/collections/{feed_id}/objects . i.e. GET v2/inthreat/collections/d6092c37-d8d7-45c3-8aff-c4dc26030608/objects/ Be aware that only the users belonging to the feed's community will be able to access it when using a custom feed. Pagination The objects endpoint returns only 100 objects by default but this value can be increased up to 2000 objects per request with the limit parameter. i.e. GET v2/inthreat/collections/{feed_id}/objects?limit=2000 The response contains the STIX Objects in items and a pagination cursor in next_cursor . You can pass this cursor using the cursor parameter to get the next page of content. i.e. GET v2/inthreat/collections/{feed_id}/objects?limit=2000&cursor={next_cursor} You can safely stop iterating when items is empty or less than the requested limit . Incremental Updates It is recommended to only fetch the full feed content the first time and then to use incremental updates. To get only the records that were created and/or modified since your last request, simply use the last next_cursor that was returned in your request. Filtering by Object Type It is possible to filter returned objects by type with the match[type] parameter. Its value should be a comma-separated list of types. i.e. GET v2/inthreat/collections/{feed_id}/objects?match[type]=indicator Note that if the type is not available in the feed it will not be returned even if specified in the query. Example Script Here is a sample Python script to fetch STIX objects from the Intelligence Center: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 import dbm import requests from posixpath import join as urljoin APIKEY = \"APIKEY\" DEFAULT_FEED = \"d6092c37-d8d7-45c3-8aff-c4dc26030608\" BASE_URL = \"https://api.sekoia.io/v2/inthreat/\" CURSOR_FILE = \"cursor.db\" def get_new_objects ( feed_id = DEFAULT_FEED , limit = 2000 ): url = urljoin ( BASE_URL , \"collections\" , feed_id , f \"objects?limit= { limit } \" ) paginated_url = url # Use the builtin dbm module to save the cursors to disk with dbm . open ( CURSOR_FILE , \"c\" ) as cursors : while True : # If a cursor exists for this feed, add it to the URL if feed_id in cursors : paginated_url = f \" { url } &cursor= { cursors [ feed_id ] . decode ( 'ascii' ) } \" # Request the next batch of objects from the API, authenticate with the APIKEY response = requests . get ( paginated_url , headers = { \"Authorization\" : f \"Bearer { APIKEY } \" } ) response . raise_for_status () data = response . json () # Yield individual STIX Objects (SDO & SRO) for item in data [ \"items\" ]: yield item # Update cursor to have incremental updates cursors [ feed_id ] = data [ \"next_cursor\" ] # Stop current iteration if we reached the last updated object if not data [ \"items\" ] or len ( data [ \"items\" ]) < limit : break Getting an indicator's context When using indicators for detection, you might want to fetch all indicators by using a filter on the indicator type and then only fetch additional context when an indicator matched. The v2/inthreat/objects/{indicator_id}/context returns a STIX bundle containing: The indicator The first level relationships and related objects Potential relevant Course-Of-Action objects Referenced Sources and Object Markings Getting an object by its ID It is possible to get a specific object by its ID by using the GET v2/inthreat/objects/{object_id} endpoint. For relationships, use the GET v2/inthreat/relationships/{relationship_id} endpoint instead. Looking for an IOC It is possible to look for a specific indicator of compromise in the Intelligence Center and get its context with the GET v2/inthreat/indicators/context endpoint (see documentation ). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 import json import requests from posixpath import join as urljoin APIKEY = \"APIKEY\" BASE_URL = \"https://api.sekoia.io/v2/inthreat/\" HEADERS = { \"Authorization\" : f \"Bearer { APIKEY } \" } def get_indicator_context ( observable_type , observable_value ): response = requests . get ( urljoin ( BASE_URL , \"indicators/context\" ), params = { \"type\" : observable_type , \"value\" : observable_value }, headers = HEADERS ) response . raise_for_status () return response . json () TAXII The Intelligence Center also exposes a TAXII 2.1 server that conforms to the specification .

Sources are represented in STIX by Identity objects. Our consolidation strategy means that the created_by_ref field of the STIX objects will always be set to the SEKOIA identity. The sources that contributed to one of our STIX object are available, as references, in the x_inthreat_sources_refs custom field. As an exemple, here are parts of the Spearphishing Link object presented in the screenshot: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 { \"type\" : \"attack-pattern\" , \"name\" : \"Spearphishing Link\" , \"id\" : \"attack-pattern--6cd1a813-ccdf-4ba0-9b54-cb808f1059cc\" , \"created_by_ref\" : \"identity--357447d7-9229-4ce1-b7fa-f1b83587048e\" , # SEKOIA \"x_inthreat_sources_refs\" : [ \"identity--357447d7-9229-4ce1-b7fa-f1b83587048e\" , # SEKOIA \"identity--c78cb6e5-0c4b-4611-8297-d1b8b55e40b5\" # The MITRE Corporation ], [...] } Confidence STIX 2.1 adds an optional confidence field for an object creator to express how confident (s)he is about the information. The Intelligence Center uses the confidence field in two ways: On objects, the confidence score may be specified to express a specific confidence level on an object. When specified, this confidence level should be read with the Admiralty Credibility scale. Score Label Explanation 1 Confirmed by other sources Confirmed by other independent sources; logical in itself; Consistent with other information on the subject 2 Probably True Not confirmed; logical in itself; consistent with other information on the subject 3 Possibly True Not confirmed; reasonably logical in itself; agrees with some other information on the subject 4 Doubtful Not confirmed; possible but not logical; no other information on the subject 5 Improbable Not confirmed; not logical in itself; contradicted by other information on the subject 6 Truth cannot be judged No basis exists for evaluating the validity of the information On source objects (of type Identity ), the confidence score may be specified to express the source's reliability.

The sort and filter choices you make from this list will be kept thereafter. On this screen, you can view the following information: Alert Id, begin with AL followed by 10 alphanumeric characters. On the top right of the ID box, there may be an yellow round with a number, it's the similarity counter. Alert creation date Alert status. When hovering over the icon, a frame indicates the status modification date and who modified it. The entity to which the alert corresponds Urgency of the alert, between 0 and 100, 100 being the highest. The category and sub-category of alerts The name of the rule which triggered the alert The source and destination IP when event is a network event. Alerts can be filtered by two ways: a rapid filter on the top left of the list and a list of cumulative filtering criteria on the top right of the screen. Alert Details The access to the detail of an alert is done by clicking on the Alert ID in the Alert list. The alert detail screen contains several blocks of information. On the largest area of the screen is a graphic representation of the alert. It represents the different objects composing the alert, each type having its self icon. The yellow magnifying glasses represent the observed data, eg the events associated with the alert. Medical suitcase corresponds to proposed countermeasures, bug on red bubble to malware, and so on. When you click on these icons, the left part of the screen will display details of the selected element. Alert type, description, kill chain phase and urgency can be modified, by clicking on the 'pencil' button on the top right of the frame. Tab with a sticking plaster icon will display proposed countermeasures linked to the alert. You can act on countermeasures, confirming or rejecting them by clicking on the corresponding icons. A countermeasure can be constituted of several action steps, which can be confirmed or rejected independently if needed. By confirming a countermeasures, you indicate to the platform that you have undertaken the corresponding action on your system. The urgency of the alert will thereby decrease, as well as the risk indicator. Countermeasures are in OpenC2 format, which you can visualize by clicking on the '<>' icon. Alert statuses and lifecycle There is five possible statuses for an alert: Pending : As soon as an alert is triggered, it is placed in 'Pending' status. If the generation mode for this alert is 'Automatic', this status changes automatically to 'Ongoing'. In other cases, the following actions are accepted: Acknowledge, Reject, Validate. Acknowledged : This status is used when an analysis is ongoing. If the analyst can decide if an alert is a true or a false positive quickly, this status can be optional, time to acknowledge used in statistics will be set to time to change to Ongoing or Rejected status.The following actions are accepted: Validate, Reject. Ongoing : Alert is considered as true positive and countermeasures are not yet been applied. This status is the first one seen in case of automatic mode. The following actions are accepted: Close (countermeasures have been applied, no more alert), Reject (after more analysis, this alert was a false positive). Closed : Every necessary actions have been applied for the alert. This status is a final status, no action accepted. Rejected : The alert was a false positive. This status is a final status, no action accepted. Alert Urgency The Urgency is a number used to give a score to the risk associated with a specific alert. It is calculated from the severity of a rule and the criticality of assets related to the alert. This gives a value between 1 (very low risk) and 100 (very high risk). The urgency is provided under two different representations on alert detail: a numerical and a textual representation. Display Value Low [0-20[ Moderate [20-40[ High [40-60[ Major [60-80[ Urgent [80-100] Similarity Alert similarity aims to regroup similar events in existing alerts. When an event matches with a rule, an alert is raised. If there is already an alert with similar information (rule, entity, source and destination), the event is associated with this existing alert rather than used to create a new one. This association is done only for Pending, Acknowledged and Ongoing alerts. If there's a matching alert on status Closed or Rejected, a new alert will be triggered by the event. Similarity counter is shown on a yellow circle on the top right of the alert id on the list. The number corresponds to the added events to an existing alert. Alert type and category The Alert Type is associated with the rule template, but can be changed with the value associated to specific indicators in case of cti rules. The Alert Type is defined according to a custom set of values derived from theReference Incident Classification Taxonomy of ENISA: abusive-usage bandwidth-download bandwidth-upload p2p high-drop abusive-content spam harmfull-speech violence malicious-code virus worm trojan spyware dialer rootkit malware botnet-drone ransomware malware-configuration c&c information-gathering scanner sniffing social-engineering portscan sweepscan appscan intrusion-attempts ids-alert brute-force exploit intrusions privileged-account-compromise unprivileged-account-compromise application-compromise bot defacement compromised backdoor availability dos ddos sabotage outage information-content-security Unauthorised-information-access Unauthorised-information-modification fraud unauthorized-use-of-resources copyright masquerade phishing vulnerable vulnerable-service other blacklist unknown other test test","title":"Alerts"},{"location":"operation_center/alerts/#alerts-management","text":"","title":"Alerts Management"},{"location":"operation_center/alerts/#alerts-list","text":"When you first connect to SEKOIA.IO, alerts list is filtered and will diplay 'New today' alerts and sorted in descending order of urgency.

Every time you enable a rule, it appears on the Framework in blue in one or many cells. Each cell represents an attack technique. The cells are clickable and enable you to see or disable the rules activated in each one. You can see how many rules are enabled in a cell by hovering over it. The color changes depending on the number of rules activated in one cell. The blue gets darker when more rules are enabled and a white cell means that no rule is activated in it. Rules attributes Typology: Two types of rules are displayed on the Rules Catalog. Available rules : All custom rules created by you in addition to the available rules in the Rules Catalog. Verified rules : Rules created by SEKOIA.IO\u2019s analysts, related to the CTI and available in the Rules Catalog. Effort level: The effort level is increasing from Elementary to Master according to two criteria: Effort needed to enable a rule. Risk of false positives. Master rules are generic and raise a lot of alerts, which need to be contextualized in a more refined way. Whereas elementary rules require less effort and raise relatively fewer alerts. The blue square represents a clickable counter of activated rules, it is therefore possible to use the filters related to the effort level by clicking on one or more of them. Capabilities: The rules are related to different elements according to offensive and defensive capabilities. They can be related to threats, attacks and data sources. Each element is associated to a filter that can be used to display the rules related to the selected element. Manage existing rules Filters: There are different filters linked to all rules attributes above. They can be used either separately or in addition to other filters and allow you to Enable or Disable all rules displayed simultaneously. Rules details: On top of the details of a rule, you can see the name, when it was released and last updated. There are information about the effort level attributed to the rule, the severity, tags that ease search, related threats. It also explains the followed strategy and gives information about false positives, STIX patterning and data sources. To edit an existing rule, click on the gear icon to select entities and assets, or to add a filter alert. Add a custom rule In addition to the rules available in the catalog provided by SEKOIA.IO, you can add your own rules. General definition of the rule: The rule name is mandatory during the creation, it will be used to name the corresponding raised alerts by default. You can add an optional description bellow. Select the effort level required and the threats detected with this rule if any, by selecting it on from the MITRE ATT&CK or by using the search bar through key words or drop-down list. Entities & Assets: You can select entities and assets manually or use all of them as a basis to filter the analyzed events. Detection rules can be applied to all events, whatever the entity to which they are attached or the assets to which they can be linked, or applied only to some of them. If you choose 'Using all entities' and 'Using all assets', rules will be applied to all events even if new entites or new assets were added since last rule modification. For rules for which some entities or some assets were selected, if new entities or new assets are created, detection will not occur on corresponding events without rule modification. Detection patterns: The signature part corresponds to the rule itself, the detection pattern applied to events. There are two type of rules: CTI or correlation. For CTI rules, you just have to select the source of the indicators: SEKOIA Intelligence Feed is an IOCs feed managed by SEKOIA's Purple Team (indicators present in the SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Center). For correlation rules, the language used is STIX Patterning. More details about this langage are given below . Security alerts: In the Alert properties part, you should indicate the category and type of the alerts raised by the rule and the severity of the rule, which is used to calculate the urgency of the corresponding raised alerts in association with assets criticality for events matching assets. Note Modification of rules parameters will be applied for new alerts, raised after the compilation of the rule. STIX Patterning Correlation rules are written using STIX Patterning. In order to enhance detection of possibly malicious activity on networks and endpoints, a standard language is needed to describe what to look for in a cyber environment. STIX, abbreviation for Structured Threat Information eXpression, is a standardized language developed by MITRE and OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee to describe information about cyber-threats. It has been adopted as an international standard by various communities and organizations sharing information. STIX Patterns are composed of multiple building blocks, ranging from simple key-value comparisons to more complex, context-sensitive expressions. The most fundamental building block is the Comparison Expression, which is a comparison between a single property of a Cyber Observable Object and a given constant using a Comparison Operator. As a simple example, one might use the following Comparison Expression (contained within an Observation Expression) to match against an IPv4 address: 1 [ipv4-addr:value = '127.0.0.1'] Observation Expressions are contained in square brackets [ ... ] and may consist of one or more Comparison Expressions joined by Boolean Operators. Observation Expressions may be followed by one or more Qualifiers, which allow for the expression of further restrictions on the set of data matching the pattern. The final, highest level building block of STIX Patterning combines two or more Object Expressions via Observation Operators, yielding a STIX Pattern capable of matching across multiple STIX Observed Data SDOs. Warning Currently, we set a limitation and only rules matching with single Observed Data, and so using only one Observation Expression contained in square brackets, are available for our customers. Note When matching an Observation against an Observation Expression, all Comparison Expressions contained within the Observation Expression MUST start matching against the same SCO in the Observation. That is, when resolving object paths of each Comparison Expression, the <object-type>:<property_name> MUST start from the same SCO. Different SCOs may ultimately be used in matching, but they MUST be referenced from the same, single SCO. An Observation Expression MAY contain Comparison Expressions with Object Paths that start with different object types, but such Comparison Expressions MUST be joined by OR . The Comparison Expressions of an Observation Expression that use AND MUST use the same base Object Path . Note Regarding the use of regular expressions ( MATCHES keyword) in STIX Patterning rules, it is necessary to escape the \u201c \\ \u201d. Thus, the STIX Patterning rule to identify countries other than France, you will need to use the following rule: [ipv4-addr:x_tags[*].name MATCHES '^country:(?!FR)\\\\w+'] For more information about STIX and STIX Patterning, please refers to the OASIS STIX Patterning specification . How to Validate STIX Patterning Rule\u2019s Syntax SEKOIA.IO checks the syntax of submitted rules and reports errors to the \u201crules\u201d interface. In order to validate your rule\u2019s syntax, you can also use an open source tool called stix2-patterns . This tool is part of the official tools developed by the OASIS Technical Committee. Here\u2019s an example on how to use that tool. These commands should be executed in a shell. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ python3 -m venv venv $ source venv/bin/activate $ pip install stix2-patterns $ validate-patterns Enter a pattern to validate: [ ipv4-addr:x_tags [ * ] .name MATCHES '^country:(?!FR)\\\\w+' ] PASS: [ ipv4-addr:x_tags [ * ] .name MATCHES '^country:(?!FR)\\\\w+' ] In this example, we are trying to validate a STIX Patterning rule that contains a regular expression ( MATCHES ). This rule is considered valid and can be submitted to SEKOIA.IO. How to Test STIX Patterning Rules? When one creates a rule in SEKOIA.IO, this one is automatically validated and applied to incoming traffic. In order to test your STIX Patterning rules, you can use an open source tool, called stix2-matcher . This tool is part of the official tools developed by the OASIS Technical Committee. First, you need to retrieve a STIX \u201cbundle\u201d from SEKOIA.IO. To do so, go to the \u201cevents\u201d page, find the event you want to work on, and export the STIX representation of that event: Export that STIX \u201cbundle\u201d in a file, called, for example, event.json . Here\u2019s an example on how to use that tool. These commands should be executed in a shell. We are also using jq a tool that helps to manipulate JSON files. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 $ python3 -m venv venv $ source venv/bin/activate $ pip install stix2-matcher $ cat event.json | jq '.objects[] | select( .type | contains(\"observed-data\") )' > observed-data.json $ cat << EOF >| patterns [ipv4-addr:value = '246.127.189.32'] [x-dns-traffic:extensions.'x-log'.hostname = 'hostname'] EOF $ stix2-matcher -f observed-data.json -p patterns MATCH: [ ipv4-addr:value = '246.127.189.32' ] MATCH: [ x-dns-traffic:extensions. 'x-log' .hostname = 'hostname' ] Observed Data In order to trigger alerts, rule patterns must match with Observed Data. An \"Observed Data\" is the internal representation of any collected event in SEKOIA.IO. All events are normalized into a JSON object compliant with the STIX Observed Data specification. Detection rules are applied on events in STIX Observed Data format. Here is an example of an Observed Data that could be obtained from a squid event: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 { \"x_sic_entity_by_ref\" : \"identity--d6358bb4-d9bb-47aa-b074-c6d1aeb673e2\" , \"created\" : \"2019-09-20T16:17:42.971Z\" , \"objects\" : { \"0\" : { \"value\" : \"127.0.0.1\" , \"type\" : \"ipv4-addr\" }, \"1\" : { \"value\" : \"216.58.215.48\" , \"type\" : \"ipv4-addr\" }, \"2\" : { \"start\" : \"2019-09-20T16:17:40.935Z\" , \"type\" : \"network-traffic\" , \"end\" : \"2019-09-20T16:17:40.935Z\" , \"extensions\" : { \"http-request-ext\" : { \"request_header\" : { \"Content-Type\" : \"application/xml\" }, \"request_method\" : \"HEAD\" , \"request_value\" : \"http://216.58.215.48/\" } }, \"src_ref\" : \"0\" , \"dst_ref\" : \"1\" , \"protocols\" : [ \"ipv4\" ] }, \"3\" : { \"type\" : \"user-account\" , \"extensions\" : { \"x-log\" : { \"hostname\" : \"DESKTOP-UPU7IFP\" } } } }, \"type\" : \"observed-data\" , ... \"x_event_type\" : \"http\" } The JSON object has a type of observed-data and is composed by smaller objects following another STIX specification: Cyber Observables . The main observable is the third one, with a type of network-traffic. It has references to indicate the source of the packet ( src_ref - 127.0.0.1 ) and its destination ( dst_ref - 216.58.215.48 ).

To assess rules efficiency, the statistics API of the SIC application was improved to report more details on the effectiveness of detection rules. One can now assess the quality of its ruleset by querying how many alerts were raised given a rule and a specified time period. In addition to the quality of the detection, we also expect our engines to process security events on a real time basis.

One of its mission is provide a knowledge base related to cybercrime and cyberthreats which is fed by our collectors and by our users. To ensure the best operational capacity for this database, we perform a complete and structured indexing of all of the observation collected. Such operation is expensive, hence, to ensure the best user experience, we implemented asynchronous indexing of the collected CTI observations as proposed in the TAXIIv2 standard. Improved threat descriptions of our CTI indicators. Our Cyber Threat Intelligence knowledge base is used, amongst others, by SIC, the detection solution implemented on SEKOIA.IO.

Configuration The user can define the list of the probes he/she wishes to connect to SEKOIA.IO. The intake feature automates the ingestion of events produced by connected probes. This version brings seven different supported formats of probes: Suricata, OpenSSH, HAProxy, Nginx, Netfilter, Squid. Detection A new detection engine is introduced with this version: the threshold engine. This major feature enables the creation fo rules to detect telemetric variations on both the number, the volume and the frequency of the events. Qualification The data model for an alert has been expanded to explicitly link a comment to a state change of the alert. This feature has been introduced so that a user can explain and justify any modification he/she introduced on an alert. A better description of an alert, the associated attack and its structure is offered to the user through the visualization of the estimated step in the Cyber KillChain the alert denotes. Reporting New metrics are offered to the user to improve his understanding of its orchestration. Among these indicators, we can cite the reporting of the type of handled events.
